Thus each student\\rwill be expected to: 1) Converse (speak with acceptable pronunciation and\\runderstand spoken French) in simple but correct French, demonstrating mastery\\rof the vocabulary and grammatical concepts. 2) Write in simple\\rbut correct French, demonstrating mastery of the vocabulary and grammatical\\rconcepts included in the Green pages of Motifs. An Introduction to French (required\\rtextbook) 3) Read and\\runderstand simple French texts, available in your Textbook under Perspectives Culturelles (From Modules 1-5) 4) Demonstrate an\\runderstanding of appropriate speech and conduct within French culture, and an\\runderstanding of cultural differences and similarities between France and the U.S. 5) To make the learning of a\\rFrench an enjoyable experience so that students will improve their\\rmastery of the language and interest in the culture (French and the Francophone\\rworld) even after the course is completed. The\\rcourse will provide basic information on French culture and civilization. It will open a global window on the\\rFrancophone World, through text material, music and videos. In addition,\\rstudents will develop valuable electronic communication skills and general presentation\\rskills. Textbook and Material Required 1. Motifs\\r: An introduction to French. (3e ed.), Jansma\\r& Kassen; Harcourt College\\rPublishers. Quia Online Card Workbook/Lab\\rManual, Jansma & Kassen;\\rHarcourt College Publishers. 2.

The\\rbook is available and can be purchased from CSU Sacramento Bookstore 3.\\rUse 2 or 3 Blank CD-R (which CANNOT be magnetic) will be burned free of\\rcharge at the language lab, MRP 2002. These CD are part of the listening\\rexercises and are excellent tools for your comprehension, and will help you\\rprepare the exercise from the Lab Manual. 4. During the first week,\\rsecure your own Saclink account to enter\\ryour webCt account. (see\\rsyllabus, announcements and grades) Method The course covers modules 1 to\\r5. Active student participation is\\rrequired. Oral comprehension and practice are essential to become comfortable\\rwith all aspects of the language and culture. Oral\\rparticipation includes, repeating, readings, games, singing, creating cultural\\rsituations and finally one final dialog. Quizzes, exercises, dictation, electronic\\rwritten responses and dialogues build lexical and grammatical skills. Listening to the lab\\raudiocassettes and completing the exercises in the Quia OnlineWorkbook/ Lab Manual, is an essential part of the\\rcourse.

[See First hourlies\\nfor Spring\\n2000, 2001,\\n& 2002\\nand Dr. White\\'s part of the Spring\\n2000 & Spring\\n2001 Final Examinations.]\\nWe assume that students who\\ntake CHEM-642 have learned the following in CHEM-641: know the structures and names\\nof the fundamental building blocks of macromolecules, have an appreciation of protein\\nstructure and function, have a basic understanding of\\nenzyme kinetics and mechanism, recognize the structures and\\nknow the chemical function of coenzymes, and understand the catabolism of\\nglucose and fatty acids to carbon dioxide and water with the formation\\nof ATP. We also assume that students\\ncan apply basic concepts learned in general chemistry, organic chemistry,\\nand general biology.\\nCHEM-642 is a graduate-level\\ncourse. We know that the students enrolled have the background and ability\\nto do well and we presume that all are interested in learning. If everyone\\ndoes high-quality work, everyone will get an \"A\" in this course. In that\\nsense, the grades are not curved. However, based on past experience, there\\nis a spectrum of performance and we have to decide what constitutes the\\nexcellence worthy of an \"A.\" Based on past results, the average grade in\\nthis course is in the B to B+ range.\\nProblem\\nSets: Tell me, and I will forget. Show me, and I may remember. Involve me, and I will understand.\"\\nThis perceptive Chinese proverb,\\nrecognizes the limited effect of lectures. Involvement is the key to learning.\\nThe process is as important as \"the answer.\" While reading and studying\\nhelp learning, solving problems focuses learning on knowledge gaps and\\nrequires one to review and integrate knowledge. We wish to promote this\\nconceptual understanding through involvement. Thus, we will assign homework\\nproblems which will be graded in the first half of the course. These challenging\\nproblems, posted on the course web-site, are intended to stimulate understanding\\nby thinking about and analyzing material from the research literature.\\nThey may require 5 to 10 hours or more per week to complete (and double\\nthat to grade). Problem sets will not be accepted after the day they are\\ndue.\\nWhile only individuals learn,\\ninteractions with others can enhance the learning process. Thus, students\\nmay work together on solving these problems. However, \"working\\ntogether\" here does not imply a divide-and-conquer approach in which students\\npool their individual work, but do not discuss it. Plagiarism or paraphrasing\\nthe work of others does not demonstrate understanding. Write-up your own\\nanswers in words that show that you understand. Also, if you work\\nin a group, indicate who you worked with on your assignments. If you are\\nuncertain about what constitutes plagiarism or how the university deals\\nwith cases of intellectual dishonesty such as plagiarism, check out the\\nstudent\\nhandbook web-site devoted to these issues.\\nCourse\\nPhilosophy: Biochemistry is a huge field and still growing.\\nEach year the Journal of Biological Chemistry\\n(JBC) publishes over 35,000 pages of research articles. Biochemistry,\\nCell,\\nScience,\\nNature, Proceedings\\nof the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and a host of other\\njournals multiply that number many fold! Even in a two-semester course,\\nthere is no way to cover\\nmany important topics that ideally\\nshould be covered. Our goal is to\\nuncover core principles\\nthat students can use and build on. Part of each examination will reflect\\nthat philosophy by including new material that must be analyzed, synthesized,\\nand evaluated in the context of the course.\\nWhile memorized facts (e.\\ng. amino acid names, structures, and one-letter representations) are important\\nto understanding biochemistry in the same way that vocabulary is important\\nto speaking a language, it is the way facts (and words) are put together\\nin conceptual frameworks that lead to understanding. We will try to provide\\nthis structure and meaning by connecting biochemical information to other\\ndisciplines such as nutrition, molecular biology, organic chemistry, medicine,\\nevolution, etc. However, there is only so much we can do. To understand\\nbiochemistry, one must be able to speak \"the language\" without a \"dictionary.\"\\nOne can gain or test that ability by working together on homework problems,\\nby attending research seminars, or by doing research.\\nExtracurricular\\nActivities: Throughout the semester there will be lectures and\\ndiscussion groups on biochemical topics. The Biochemistry\\nSeminar meets Mondays at 4 PM in 214 Brown Laboratory. This weekly\\nseries features distinguished biochemists talking about their current research.\\nIn addition, seminars in the Physical/Analytical\\nChemistry Seminar Series on Mondays, the Organic/Inorganic\\nSeminar Series on Wednesdays, and the Biological Sciences Seminar Series\\non Wednesdays often deal with topics of biochemical interest. There also\\nis a Science Education Seminar Series this semester. At noon on Fridays,\\nthere is a Biochemistry Journal Club in 212 Brown Laboratory where faculty\\nand graduate students present material from the recent biochemical literature.\\nStudents are welcome at all of these. Although course credit is not obtained\\nby attending these presentations, they provide an opportunity to expand\\nand consolidate your biochemical knowledge. You are especially encouraged\\nto attend if you are doing or plan to do research in a biochemically-related\\nfield. A list of speakers and their topics is posted on the Department\\'s\\nweb-site.

      "[' HISTORY 661 APR AUG Sep 19 2003 2004 2005 3 captures\\n29 Feb 04 - 19 Aug 04 Close\\nHelp HISTORY 661 Professor Jules Tygiel Tuesdays, 4:10-7:30 Science 224, x81119 http://bss.sfsu.edu/tygiel/hist661 hist685@sfsu.edu Office Hours: TU 3-4, W 6-7 INTRODUCTION TO SPSS The purpose of this course will be to introduce students to the compilation, access, and analysis of databases using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Students will learn to create databases, locate databases on the internet and be given an introduction to statistical analysis. During the first part of the course students will perform statistical analysis based on a database provided by the instructor and write an explanatory paper. During the latter portion of the course, students will select their own base from the Internet and perform data analysis on that database and write a paper. OPTIONAL SOFTWARE: I strongly advise all students who wish to work at home and have Windows home computers that are powerful enough to handle it to purchase copies of the SPSS 10.0 Student Version. These software packages (or the graduate student versions of SPSS 10.0 for students) are available at the bookstore, or, you may order them directly from Prentice Hall through their Web page: www.prenhall.com. Use their search engine and ask for SPSS 10.0. Unfortunately they are not cheap. COURSE PREREQUISITES: All students enrolled in this course are expected to have completed History 660 or have commensurate computer skills. These skills include: 1) Familiarity with the BSS Computer Network 2) Familiarity with a Windows environment 3) Ability to manage files in these environments. 4) Ability to use e-mail (You must have an e-mail account). 5) Familiarity with Netscape, Internet Explorer or other web browsers. 6) Ability to use internet search tools. GRADING: The major part of the final grade will be based on the two reports indicating how well students have mastered SPSS and can apply it to the databases. These reports will be due on April 13 and May 25. There will also be assignments for students to demonstrate their competency in using SPSS. LECTURE AND LABORATORY: The class consists of two sections: lecture and laboratory. In general, the session from 4:10 to 5:40 will be devoted to lecture and the session from 5:40 to 7:30 to a laboratory session. However, different subjects will require more discussion time than others, necessitating extending the lectures into the laboratory session. At other times, the instructor might alternate lecture and discussion for shorter periods. It is essential that students attend lectures, as most of the material we will be studying is not covered in the textbooks. The laboratory sessions are optional, but they are the best time for students to complete their assignments and work out any problems they have with the instructor. Contrary to the course schedule, since we will not be taking a break between the lecture and laboratory sessions, the class will end at 7:20. All students should bring a zip disk or two 3-1/2 inch, high-density, double-sided disks to the laboratory sessions. They are available at the bookstore. STATISTICS: This course is not a class in statistics, but it will provide a brief introduction and review of basic statistical concepts. For those of you who need additional help with the statistical part of the course, I suggest the following texts: Freeman F. Elzey, A Programmed Introduction to Statistics Frederick Williams, Reasoning With Statistics Derek Rowntree, Statistics Without Tears: a Primer for Non- Mathematicians John L. Phillips, How To Think About Statistics READING ASSIGNMENTS AND CLASS SCHEDULE\\n(This schedule will be highly flexible. Some topics may take us less time than anticipated, others more. If there are any additional subjects that you wish to cover or additional things that you wish to do with the data, let the instructor know. We will adjust the syllabus accordingly.)

Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2006. 2!CATALOG DESCRIPTION: An intensive examination of the judiciary, focusing upon the politics of judicial selection and the decision-making process of the judiciary as well as the position of the judiciary in the entire political process. Credit Hours: 3.00 DESCRIPTION AND GOAL OF COURSE: This course is designed to acquaint students with the place of courts and jurisprudence within the U. S. political system. The goal is to encourage students to think critically about the principles that guide judges in reaching decisions as well as the principles that ought to guide them. Consequently, this course includes an evaluation of various theories about the nature of law and an evaluation of various theories about how law should be interpreted. As well, this course endeavors to inculcate in students knowledge of the structure or design of the U. S. court system at the state and federal level. This includes consideration of both the power of and the limits upon the judiciary. This course also aims to equip students to reflect upon the place that courts (whether local, state, or federal) occupy within our political system. What is it that courts do within our system? What is it that courts ought to do within our system? Both questions are asked in view of the fact that courts operate within a larger constitutional framework as well as in light of the fact that the U. S. Constitution is committed to popular sovereignty and consequently to some variant of majority rule. Consequently, students will be asked to consider whether or not judicial review is required by constitutionalism and whether or not it is compatible with popular sovereignty. Concomitantly, students will be asked to consider the appropriate way to select judges in a political system such as ours by reflecting upon the fact that state judges are most frequently elected while federal judges are appointed. In reflecting on these matters, students will be asked to address the basic tension between the rule of law as applied by courts and majority rulea difficulty referred to by scholars as the counter-majoritarian difficulty. OBJECTIVES OF COURSE: General Learning Objectives: This course seeks to . . . 1. Familiarize students with basic theories about the nature of law and basic theories about how judges ought to interpret and apply the law. 2. Acquaint students with the basic structure of the U. S. judicial system at the federal and state level. 3. Encourage students to think critically about the role of courts within our constitutional republic and to think about what that role ought to be. 4. Enable students to evaluate critically U. S. judicial processes. 3!Specific Behavioral Objectives: As a result of the activities and study in this course, the student should be able to . . . 1. Describe and evaluate various theories about the nature of law and basic theories about how judges interpret the law. 2. Describe accurately the basic structure of the U. S. judiciary at the state and federal level, including a description of the extent and limitations of judicial power at various levels in the U. S. system. 3. Describe and evaluate the role of courts in the U. S. system, including the ability to argue about the appropriateness of judicial review and the ability to give an argument concerning the proper way of selecting judges in a system committed to popular sovereignty. 4. Assess the U. S. judicial system and give an appraisal of it, including the ability to defend it or to make recommendations for its improvement. RESPONSIBILITIES OF STUDENTS: 1. To attend class. This includes arriving on time and staying for the duration of the class time. 2. To participate in class discussion regularly. 3. To be respectful of others in the room, which includes being civil when engaging in exchanges or debate with others and which includes refraining from any ad hominem argumentation. 4. To refrain from distracting others. All cell phones, pagers, etc., must be turned off during lecture and examinations. Students must not play games or do email or watch movies, etc. on electronic devices during class. Computers can only be used for taking notes. 5. To read assigned readings in advance of the day on which they will be discussed. 6. To complete all assignments and to turn them in at the assigned time. 7. To do his or her own work and to adhere to standards of scholastic integrity. EVALUATION: Minimum Requirements: Turning in all major assignments is a minimum condition for passing the course. Students who fail to turn in major assignments are therefore in danger of failing the course. Attendance: Regular attendance is essential to succeeding in the course. Students with perfect attendance (i.e., no absences) will receive 2% extra credit on their final course average. Students with only one absence will receive 1% extra credit on their final average. Students with two or more absencesfor any reasonwill receive no extra credit for attendance. Students who are absent 7 or more times will have their final grade reduced by one letter grade. Students who are absent 14 or more times will have their final grade reduced by two letter grades or will receive a failing grade for the course. Finally, attendance is used to resolve borderline grades. Regular attendance is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for a borderline grade to be rounded up. 4!Participation: Student participation is also essential to succeeding in this class. Participation involves participating in class discussions as well as participating in any group activities prescribed by the instructor. Participation, like attendance is used to determine whether or not to curve a students course average. A minimum requirement for participating in the class is to be in regular attendance. Examinations: There will be a midterm and a final examination. Each exam will comprise 1/3rd of the overall course average. Exams will include a multiple choice and a written component. The written component, and the discretion of the professor, may be given as a take-home assignment. The multiple choice component will given during class for the midterm and during the scheduled time for the final exam. Paper: Each student will write a scholarly paper that constitutes 1/3rd of the overall course grade. Instructions for writing the paper will be given in class and must be followed in order to receive full credit on the paper. Students will have the opportunity to submit two drafts of the paper and to improve their initial grade based on revision of the draft originally submitted. All students are required to submit the first draft. It is left to the student's discretion as to whether to submit a further revised draft. Cheating: A student will automatically receive a zero on any assignment on which he or she is caught cheating and may receive a failing grade in the course pursuant to the procedures outlined in the Honor Code. Grading Scale: A: 90-100 D: 60-69 B: 80-89 F: 59 and below C: 70-79 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Texas State University-San Marcos expects students to engage in all academic pursuits in a manner that is beyond reproach. Students found in violation of the Honor Code are subject to disciplinary action. To support the goal of maintaining a climate of academic honesty, Texas State has adopted a modified Honor Code. Read the full document U.P.P.S. No. 07.10.01 5!STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: Qualified students with disabilities are entitled to reasonable and appropriate accommodations in accordance with federal laws including Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, and university policy UPPS 07.11.01 Disability Services. Recommended accommodations may included extended time on exams, tape recording of class lectures, use of a lap top computer in class to take notes, assistance with locating a volunteer note taker, sign language/oral interpreting services and captioning services. A faculty member may recommend an alternate accommodation as long as it is equally effective and achieves the same result. As a prerequisite to establishing the need for accommodations, Texas State requires the student provide documentation of disability to the Office of Disability Services (ODS). This documentation should be from a medical professional qualified to diagnosis the disability. Professional ODS staff will review the documentation according to university criteria to determine the students eligibility for accommodations. A student who is qualified by the ODS for accommodations is responsible for presenting an Academic Accommodation Letter and Academic Accommodation Form prepared by the ODS to each faculty member. Following a discussion of accommodations relevant to the course, the faculty members signature is obtained on the Academic Accommodation Form. The ODS will send a copy of the Academic Accommodation Letter either electronically or by hard copy to the faculty member within 24 hours after the student returns the documentation to ODS. 6!POSI 4311: Course Calendar Note: Course Calendar subject to alteration at the Professors discretion Date Topic Assignment T Jan 15 Introduction Syllabus H Jan 17 The Nature of Law: Natural Law Murphy and Coleman, 6-19.

Posted by\\nLens Khoo at\\n11:19 AM 0\\ncomments Labels:\\nPhotography Work Routine >>Saturday, July 17, 2010 I read some of my mates blog, and discovered that my blog\\'s link was stacked down to the bottom of the page. Unsurprising, as I didn\\'t keep my blog updated for few months due to \"After Work Depressing Syndrome\". Haha... That was a crap actually.Speaking of my work, I do not have much story as working is just keeping loops circulating. Don\\'t have much surprise for my daily routine:6.30 am : Wakes up tiredly from bed. I sleeps more that I did in Cyberjaya but this is what I just can\\'t explain.7.10 am - 7.40 am : Drives from house and reaches company. Reaching early doesn\\'t mean I start my work early, as trainees are not allowed to have desktops and I am basically borrowing laptop from company. Getting laptop from people who is late to work is troublesome. I never reach my office late, but there\\'s once I reach office at 8.08 and that breaks my clean record.8.30 am -8.45 am: Has short breakfast break in company. Breakfast food in canteen used to be nice last time, but not anymore ever since they changed the \"service provider\".9.00 am -11.00 am: Starts my daily work. Occasionally, watching my colleague playing minesweeper. Haha ... I think she will see this eventually.11.00 am - 11.45 am: Starts getting restless, emotionally flies to elsewhere, thinking of where to eat lunch.12.00 pm - 1.00 pm: I separate this part into 2 parts here. Firstly, eating in company just takes us 15 to 30 minutes. The leftover free time are used to either having a small sleep, completing undone work, playing minesweeper or FB. Need not to say, eating outsides consumes traveling time, which all the unproductive actions after meals are traded for traveling.1.00 pm - 4.00 pm: Continues my work.4.00 pm - 4.45 pm: Everyone starts to think something else again. For me and another 2 trainees, we always think on how to spend the unfinished allowance on something like boxes of fruit juice. Why? Particularly it\\'s because the canteen staffs always import those fruit juice in the afternoon, at the time that normally the canteen is empty. Another why? I just don\\'t know the reason. Might have to ask them.4.58 pm - 5.00 pm : OK, here i particularly stressing the time 4.58 pm as at that time, somebody is shutting down his laptop. Haha ... He just don\\'t want to lost a single minute for the company and normally he is leaving at 5.00 pm, or sometimes 5.01 pm. For myself, I shuts down my laptop at 5 pm and leaves the office at 5.05 pm unless there are uncompleted tasks. However, suffice to say, leaving at 5.05 pm is the latest among the trainees, which makes myself to be understandably proud.5.30 pm - 6.00pm: Reaching home in this range of time, depending on the traffic. From then, my real life starts :-) Read more...

Partly, there are some stories I found it unsuitable to share.I can\\'t label myself as a hot tempered guy, but recently there is people who made me real mad. To be exact, this fellow blamed twice his fault to me. I kept quiet, but doesn\\'t mean I allowed him to do so. I stepped back as I don\\'t like to quarrel.Alright, just ignore that. Since I wasn\\'t updating my blog for a long time, perhaps I should update the readers with some information. I just finished my final exam for my Delta year. Moving into the final year of my study, I will be committing my internship in Plexus for 4 months starting from next week.Just hope that, I will be able to cope with the load full of works to be come.

This year it was hosted by the\\nUniversity of Saskatchewan in the western\\nmetropolis of Saskatoon, where snow is never\\nploughed, cattle cause traffic jams, and liquor\\nstores are open until the wee hours of the\\nmorning.In reality, we saw much less of Saskatoonand much more of the Radisson Hotel, where\\nwe attended workshops, listened to speakers,\\nand enjoyed the company of fellow engineering\\nstudents for a week. Workshops ranged in\\ntopic from How to hold a charity event to\\nEngineering Legal Liability, and were\\nfacilitated either by individuals from one of the\\n40 member societies in Canada or by the CFES\\nnational executive itself. Not only were\\nCanadian students involved at the conference,\\nbut there were also observers in attendance\\nfrom our American counterpart (NAESC), ourSkuleTM Shines at CFES Congress 2003U. of T. wins awards, executive\\npositions, and right to host Congress\\nin 2005Mike BranchCOMP OT3\\nWith files from Ahmed FarooqCOMP OT5European friends (BEST), and the German\\nengineering student collective (BONDING).This year, our delegation was made up ofan exceptional group of students who\\nrepresented the university very well. Sunaina\\nMenezes (our Hi-Skule Liaison officer here at\\nU. of T.), successfully ran for a CFES\\ndirectorship and has now become the\\nfederations new Outreach Commissioner.\\nJamy Li will continue on for a second year as\\nPresident of the CFES Caf (www.cfescafe.ca),\\nand many thanks to Richard Wiltshire (SIC\\nChair) for putting in so much effort throughout\\nhis term here at U. of T., because it landed us\\nwith the provincial Charity Challenge award\\n(which has been with arch-rival Queens for the\\npast few years)!All in all, Congress was a great experienceand presents a fantastic opportunity for\\nstudents to become more involved as leaders\\nin the world of engineering. The CFES\\nmaintains a professional partnership with the\\nCanadian Council of Professional Engineers\\n(CCPE) which has allowed them to take onmany exciting initiatives, including theCanadian Engineering Competition (CEC),\\nProject Magazine, and the CFES Caf, to namea few.U. of T. has such a huge student body incomparison to many of the schools that make\\nup CFES that it is often difficult to excite\\ninterest in these national organizations. In\\nfuture, I hope to see more engineering students\\ninvolved with the CFES. To help promote this\\ninvolvement, we delivered a bid to host the\\nconference right here in Toronto in 2005and\\nwon! So keep your eyes peeled to your ECF\\nmail account (i.e. dont just delete the mail that\\nreads from the Engineering Society), because\\nwe will be looking to put together a strong team\\nto showcase U. of T. to the rest of Canada in\\nJanuary 2005!If you have any questions or commentsabout the CFES or anything mentioned in this\\narticle, please contact your VP External, Mike\\nBranch (vpexternal@skule.ca).TAREK SAGHIR the CANNONthe CANNONThe CANNON is a forum for student expres-sion as the official newspaper of The Engi-neering Society at The University ofToronto.

Layout EditorPhoto EditorGraphics EditorBusiness ManagersCopy EditorsLayoutContributorsI dont usually obsess overthings. For example: I have\\nnever seen Titanic in its en-tirety, never mind thirteen\\ntimes in the theatre. But let me\\ntell you, the closest I have ever gotten to obses-\\nsion has been in the past year or so with The Lordof the Rings movies.Of course, its true that I am a big nerdalways have been and always will be, and no one\\nwill ever tell you otherwise. It is a common per-\\nception that being both a nerd and an engineer-\\ning student practically guarantees that you\\nshould be obsessed about The Lord of the Ringsin one way or another (and Im sure this can be\\nproven with the stat mech formulas I have\\nforgotten already). But this almost-obsession of\\nmine is weird because it shouldnt really be my\\nkind of thing.Yes, I loved the book, but I think thats simplybecause I read it in Grade 5 and it was my first\\nencounter with an epic with magnificent scope\\nand breathless romancenot in the sense of love,but in the older sense of a mysterious or\\nfascinating quality or appeal, as of something\\nadventurous, heroic, or strangely beautiful\\n(American Heritage Dictionary). I dont thinkIve even read the trilogy again all in one go. Other\\nthan Tolkien and books for young adults, such asDanica LamNSCI 0T5Harry Potter and Philip Pullmans beautiful\\ntrilogy, His Dark Materials, I have to admit thatI generally cant get into a fantasy novel.I dont like film adaptations of books either.I could probably count on one hand the number\\nof adaptations that I liked, and a couple of them\\nare on that list because I thought the book was\\nbad to begin with.And Tolkiens Middle Earth? Come on. Anantiquated, testosterone-powered, war-monger-\\ning, Luddite world where the blond-haired good\\nmen come from the West and the dark-skinned\\nbad men come from the East? The principles I\\nwas brought up with cover their faces in shame\\nwhenever I remember this.Really, I have no idea why I should love thesemovies so much that I get indignant when I read\\nlukewarm reviews of them. Some of you snarkier\\npeople out there are probably wondering if a\\ncertain elf or possibly even a certain Ranger is\\nthe attraction, but I would have to say no (or\\nmostly no). All I can say is that Peter Jacksons\\nfilms can make me believe, for three hours at a\\ntime, in the phrase, Movie Magic.So if anyone can figure out how this can makeme ignore the three objections I raised (and\\nespecially the last one), I would be very grateful.\\nMeanwhile, Ill continue working on my design\\nproject as I wait for the third film. See you all\\nthere.Slave to the RingsThe Green PThe Green PThe Green PThe Green PThe Green PaperaperaperaperapersssssThe University of Toronto is currently con-ducting a round of long-term strategic plan-ning. This discussion was initiated with the re-lease of four green papers, each on a particular\\ntopic. Of particular interest to the undergradu-ate student body is the paper on The StudentExperience (available at http://www.utoronto.ca/plan2003/green.htm).After reading these papers, students, fac-ulty, etc. are supposed to attend Town Hall\\nmeetings, held in January and February, todiscuss various issues that interest them. Inaddition, electronic surveys are routinely made\\navailable online, and are used to collectfeedback on issues related to the Green Papers.While there has been much talk at this uni-versity about excellence, innovation andrankings, we rarely hear as much talk about theundergraduate student experience. One piece\\nof information that I did read was a survey,entitled the University Report Card, thatranked U. of T. 24th in terms of student satis-\\nfaction. While some have arguednot withoutmeritthat the survey is flawed, for it is unfairto compare a small university in a college town\\nto a huge university in a bustling metropolis,the fact remains that there is definitely roomfor improvement in the student experience\\ncategory. Who knows best about this issue? Wedo. What should we do about it? Attend thesetown hall meetings, and tell the university ad-\\nministration how to improve our undergradu-ate experience.The next, and last, town hall meeting willbe held on Friday, February 14, 10:00 am -11:30 am, at New Colleges Wilson HallAmphitheatre, Room 1016.Tareks EditorialTarek SaghirCHEM 0T5ExExExExExererererercising Ycising Ycising Ycising Ycising Your Right Tour Right Tour Right Tour Right Tour Right To Speak Upo Speak Upo Speak Upo Speak Upo Speak UpMany people that I speak to seem to forgetthat we live in a democracy. They assume that\\ngovernment is controlled by big business andspecial interest groups, and that they, theordinary citizens, can do little of significance.\\nWhile I do not deny the influence ofcorporations and lobby groups (on a side-note:there is legislation on its way to limit the\\ninfluence of these afore-mentioned groups), Ido disagree with the idea that the commoncitizen can do nothing. Thankfully, in this\\ncountry, we still have the ability to vote, andour votes are actually used to elect our leaders.These leaders, therefore, can only get away with\\nthings that we let them get away with.

Most importantly, stayinformed, and write letters to your governmentrepresntatives, to give them your view on how\\nthey should approach day-to-day policy issues.At one conference that I attended, it wasclaimed that letters (i.e. snail mail, not email)\\nreceived by the government are taken veryseriously. Apparently, the odds of someonewriting in are about 1/5000, so a letter\\nexpressing a viewpoint on a matter is taken torepresent the voices of five thousand people.So, for instance, if you oppose exchanging\\ncivilan lives for oil, dont just fume about it inSuds.

Why?! It\\nwouldnt have taken more than twoseconds. Instead I went around fortwo-and-a-half years loudly asking\\npeople to pass me my rubber,innocently returning their stunnedlooks and wondering why\\nCanadians were so strange. (Mustbe all the snow.) It wasnt until thefinal month of my OAC year, two-\\nand-a-half years after my arrival inCanada, that one friend casuallyinformed mejust in passingthat\\nI should probably use the worderaser instead. (I just thought youmight want to know rubber meanscondom here. Good gracious, youjust thought I wanted to know?!!)Well, at least that explained a lot of\\nthings, like the way everybodyshead would wheel around everytime I said The Word, and how my\\nfriends would ask with a raisedeyebrow and a smirk, Your rub-ber? Yeah, my rubber, I would\\nloudly repeat, all the while wonder-ing if there was something wrongwith the way I pronounced it.And that, my friends, brings meto this article. I have compiled thiseasy-to-follow guide for your\\nassimilation into the Canadianrace, so you wont have to sufferthrough the same embarrassment\\nas unknowingly as I did. (But do itknowingly with my blessing.) Ofcourse, I will admit I only know one\\nother English student in engineer-ing, so I realise this article has avery limited audience and even\\nlower practicality. Therefore I shalladdress the guide not only to theBritish idiot (sorry, Im not refer-\\nring to my one English friend), butalso to those delusional and neu-rotic individuals who wish to pre-\\ntend to be British idiots pretendingto be Canadian (idiot or not, I shallleave that to your personal\\npreference). As you can see, thatsignificantly widens my readership.Alright, lets get down to business,\\nshall we?Now, the first thing to remem-ber about being Canadian is to re-\\nvere their obsession with icehockey. Never under any circum-stances (unless at gunpoint,\\nknifepoint, penpoint or any otherpointy and potentially lethal ob-jects) reveal your level of disinter-\\nest in a game that rarely sees thelight of day in a country with asnowfall of around three\\nmillimetres a year at best. If for anyreason youve attended any icehockey games in the past, rave\\nabout it to anybody you meet re-gardless of age, gender or height,and refer to it as the defining\\nmoment(s) of your life. While wereon the topic of sports, rememberthat football is called soccer, rugbyis called football, and the plural ofmoose is still moose.This leads us to the weather.Adaptation to this blustery climate,unfortunately, is something that\\nonly comes with practice, if at allmany have died trying. Summerdays are long and glorious, with the\\nsky extending for miles without anytrace of a cloud. Just try not to siton a lake on a sunny day in a boat\\ncovered with tin foil. Autumnwould be even better than summer,what with the maple leaves turning\\nred all around, if only one werentin SkuleTM. But that cant be helped.Winter is another story completely.\\nBuried in three feet of snow orwading through streetfulls of saltymush, its difficult to maintain the\\nwill to live. But youll find thatbuying multicoloured scarves in allpossible patterns will lighten your\\nwintry mood (sorry about the pun,I couldnt resist).But you do have to give themcredit for their national anthem.\\nIts catchy, sounds nice in French,and is therefore far better than GodSave the Queen. Memorise it at allcosts, because you will be calledupon to sing it solo some day infront of two hundred of your\\nclassmates, with four hundred coldeyes burning the base of your spineas you falter on the line glorious\\nand free. Canadians seem to bemuch more patriotic than theBritish, despite all our empire pride\\nand whatnot. Even as they struggleto carve themselves a distinctiverole in the international community\\nand strive for recognition as an in-dependent nation thats not aboutto be integrated into the Great\\nAmerican Master Plan (yeah right,try telling that to Bush), they exudea confident love for their homeland\\nthats quite contagious. I am sureyou too will learn that the wry, self-deprecating humour (while Brits\\ntend to be sarcastic abouteverybody else, Canadians aresnarky about themselves) thinly\\nveils an honest awareness of theirown shortcomings and strengths,as well as a great love for every-\\nthingwarts and all. They donthave the grand delusions of great-ness or snobbish egos of their\\nneighbours down south (I mean, er,Mexico of course), and youll likethem all the better for it. I guess\\nthats what true patriotism is allabout, eh? By the way, in case therewere ever any doubts, its true: Ca-\\nnadians are the only people to everuse the term, eh. And so very.Very. Liberally.For anybody who does theirown cooking (my culinary reper-toire extends no further than in-\\nstant noodles, so you might bebetter off taking my words with adollop of salt, pun unfortunately in-tended), food is seasonal here.Unlike in England, where at least\\nhalf the food on our plates wasimported from all over the worldand we grew nothing worth men-\\ntioning (that I know of) exceptgrains, some vegetables and lots oflivestock, foods from all across thespectrum are grown in Canada.Which means prices and\\navailability fluctuate quite a bitdepending on the season. So ifyoure dead set on constant selec-\\ntion and more or less constantprices, you might be a bit put off.But hey, at least you can go fruit\\npicking here! When its in season,that is.No self-respecting compiler ofa Canadianism-for-idiots guidewould omit to tackle the problemof language. After all, Canada is\\njust one border away from theAmericans, and we all know howcorrupt their language is, dont we?\\nTo begin with, substitute all yourouts with oots. As preposterousas it may seem, its actually how\\nmany people pronounce thesyllable (applicable only inCanada). Now, replace your t\\nsounds with an l. So water wouldbecome something like waller, andSaturday will be Sallerday. Do\\nuse your common sense on this one,though, and resist the urge toconvert to(o) to loo. Finally,\\nsprinkle your sentences generouslywith the term eh, and nobody willever suspect you were anything but\\nborn and bred in Canada. The termis suitable for use in any context, oc-casion, and dose, so go wild. Now\\nas for specific terminology, I canonly think of a few Canadianwords, though there are in fact\\ncountless numbers of them. A lorryis called a truck; try to call a toilet abath/washroom to avoid odd looks;\\nand I cannot stress this enough, arubber is more commonly known asan eraser. Also, since this is an ar-\\nticle for engineers, I must mentiona few pointers on the topic ofswearing. Replace terms like\\nbollocks and arsehole with crapand asshole, respectively, anddont try to offend people by\\nholding out the back of your pointerand middle fingers in an invertedpeace sign. Only the middle fingeron its own will do for this purpose.On to money. While we allknow that Canadian (and evenAmerican, for that matter) moneyis worth next to nothing, its still a\\nbloody outrage the amount of taxeswere expected to fork over aroundhere. Forty percent in income tax\\nis scandalousI mean, its eightypercent of fifty percent. Imagine!And dont forget to fill out those\\nhorrid tax return forms every year,or at least blackmail somebody intodoing them for you. If youre\\nanything like me, you wont like theway they add on an extra 15% topurchases either.

Consider the\\nhypothetical case of Joe Blow, who\\ntakes only two courses per semes-\\nter. In semester one, Joe scores\\n80% in both his courses, resulting\\nin an average of 80% and a GPA\\nscore of 3.7. In the following se-\\nmester, Joe scores 84% in one\\ncourse, and 79% in the next course.\\nHis semester average has increased\\nby 1.5%, to 81.5%. However, as a 79\\nfalls in the range of a B+, and not\\nof an A-, his GPA has dropped\\nfrom 3.7 to 3.5 (3.5 = (3.3 + 3.7) /\\n2). His average has increased, but\\nhis GPA has decreased. This is non-\\nsensible at best.In most courses offered at theUniversity of Toronto, students are\\ngiven a letter grade in addition to a\\nnumeric grade. This letter grade is\\nobtained by means of a system of\\nnumeric ranges. For instance, a\\nmark between 80 to 84 percent is\\nconsidered an A-. The GPA system\\nworks in a similar fashion. Every\\nletter grade assigned to a course\\ncorresponds to a certain GPA\\nnumber. An A is 4.0, an A- is 3.7, a\\nB+ is 3.3, etc. The final GPA score\\nis the average of the GPA numbers\\nof each course (with special care\\ntaken to deal with those courses\\nthat are weighted more heavily than\\nothers).

I want to clear upsome misconceptions that peoplehave about the engineering field,\\nespecially considering the fact thatmost engineering inventions affectother occupations in one way or\\nanother. Although I have heardmany ways in which people havetried to reason out their ranking, I\\nwant to present my views on theirthree main reasons.First, people say that doctorssave human lives while engineers donot. Sorry, but I dont think so!Doctors do save human lives, but\\nwithout using the latest equipmentand latest technology, their work isquite limited. Without the inven-\\ntion of proper electrical lighting, candoctors do surgeries at night? With-out the invention of computerized\\ntomography (CT) or computerizedaxial tomography (CAT), can doc-tors detect brain abnormalities\\nfaster? The examples are limitless,and I believe that engineers saveeven more lives. Moreover, doctors\\ncan only save people who are theirpatients but engineers do not needto be in direct contact with people\\nto save their lives. Consider, forexample the safety of current build-ings with respect to fire hazards. If\\nit werent for engineering design, wecould end up losing more lives infire disasters, the most prominent\\nexample being September 11. Sowho do you think saves more lives:engineers, doctors or both through\\ntheir collaboration?Secondly, people tell me thatthey employ such rankings because\\nlawyers earn more money than doc-tors, who earn more than engineers.But is comparing salaries the way\\nto rank professions? You probablyknow some situations where peopledo illegal work. So if these people\\nearn more money than lawyers,shouldnt their profession be rankedeven higher? It is completely ridicu-\\nlous to rank a profession basedsolely on earnings.Thirdly, people say to me thatdoctors and lawyers have stabilityin their professions while engineersdo not. Okay, this reason stands\\nsomewhat, at least considering thefact that the current market is notthat strong for IT people. But isnt\\nthere something called personalinterest? I do not think that thestability of any profession can be\\nmeasured by the ups and downs inthe economy. It depends more onthe way people handle and work in\\ntheir profession. Moreover, if every-body started to become doctors orlawyers, wouldnt there then be a\\nrecession for doctors and lawyersas well?So the next time a person triesto rank doctors and lawyers aboveengineers, you know exactly what tosay.Manu SudELEC 0T5Why Are Doctorsand Lawyers Still\\nRanked Above\\nEngineers?is a complete waste; you cantstudy anything in such a shorttime.

Organizations that were\\ninvolved this year include: theUniversity of Toronto EngineeringSociety, UTRA, IEEE, Engineers\\nWithout Borders, the Nano Club,and the Chem Club.Although there were manythings that could definitely be im-proved for next year (i.e. having anevasive plan of action for a fire\\nalarm in the Bahen Centre duringthe middle of Parliamentary De-bate), the idea of UTEK seemed to\\ngenerate much enthusiasm amongthe students who participated.The event ranged from interest-ing project displays in the foyer ofthe Bahen Centre for Corporate andEntrepreneurial Design, towatching as towers of paper and\\ntape miraculously withstood loadsof pop-filled crates in the FroshTeam Design category.In the end, the competitiondefinitely would not have been asuccess without the many individu-\\nals (faculty and students) who gen-erously volunteered their time andmoney in the months prior to the\\nevent. Deserving of specialrecognition are Mrta Ecsedi andthe Alumni Association, without\\nwhom the competition would neverhave taken place, and of course ourfood guru Andrea Cassano who\\nsuccessfully took on the role offeeding a hungry crowd of engineersthroughout the day.Again, thank you to all volun-teers and participants who madethis years competition a success.

Of course, I am\\ntalking about a different type of club-bing. In fact, the University ofToronto is full of clubs that are su-\\npervised by SAC (Student Adminis-trative Council). Each club is estab-lished by a group of members\\n(executives) who have certain goalsthat they want to achieve throughtheir clubs events.Among all the clubs at theUniversity of Toronto, however, theNutrition Club caught my attention.\\nTherefore, I interviewed its presi-dent, Amani Saif. She said that theclubs purpose is to increase the\\nstudents awareness of how healthyeating habits can directly help thebody cope with stressful lifestyles\\nand enhance physical, mental, andpsychological well-being. It is a factthat we, students, face a lot of stress\\nduring our academic year. We usu-ally get addicted to caffeine, hopingthat it will help us stay awake and be\\nmore productive. However, what wedo not know is that caffeine has anegative effect on the body. Because\\nwe force it to get hyper, it will needsome extra rest after the effect of thecaffeine is gone; hence, the body will\\nfeel extra tired. Instead of destroy-ing our bodies to get a short-termeffect, we can use the help of this Nu-\\ntrition Club that will offer interactiveworkshops based on membersneeds. Amani said that there will be\\na list of suggested topics and that themembers will vote on the topic of thenext workshop. Some of these top-\\nics are:\\n1.Nutrition basics: The link be-tween having good digestion andenergy, allergies, weight manage-\\nment and degenerative diseases.2.Sports nutrition day: Creat-ine, glutamine, protein, anabolicand steroids supplementation for\\nathletes and body builders.3.Foods for thought: Brain neu-rotransmitters and foods that\\ndirectly affect their functioning.\\nFoods that help enhance memoryand concentration.4.Nutritional Supplementa-tion: When to take them, andhow to shop for them.5.Dieting and weight manage-ment: What to do to reach ahealthy weight.There will also be some games,contests, and guest speakers to makeabsorbing the nutritious informationeasier, more effective, and more fun.Moreover, the most useful toolthat will help students to get per-sonal advice is the Nutrition Ques-\\ntionnaire. This questionnaire con-sists of 700 yes/no questions thatwill help in exploring the bodys cur-\\nrent condition and symptoms forpossible diseases or weaknesses.Amani said that it is considered bet-\\nter than a blood test since it is acategorized one. Each category dealswith different body symptoms.\\nBased on the questionnaires results,each student will get more person-alized help. However, according to\\nthe legal notice attached in the ClubConstitution, [the] nutritional guid-ance provided through the club is\\nstrictly for promoting nutritionalwell-being. It is not intended for di-agnosis of any disease or ailment, nor\\ndoes it suggest any treatment of anykind. On the other hand, it is alwaysa good idea to learn more about our\\nbodies and to answer our questionsabout improving our bodies produc-tivity and efficiency using the right\\nnutrition.To help you explore this amaz-ing club, here is its official email ad-\\ndress for any further questions:nutritionclub@scientist.com.UTEK 11 the CANNON|February 4, 2003 Volume XX Issue VOn October 25, a team of threebrave engineers set their boat inLake Ontario. It was the RecyclingCouncil of Ontarios recyclable ca-\\nnoe competition. The purpose of thecompetition was to build a canoeout of PET class 1 plastic, which is\\nmost commonly found in waterbottles. The canoe was then to bepresented in front of a panel of\\njudges who evaluated it in terms ofhow well and how environmentallyfriendly it was constructed.First to present was Waterloo 1,a very high-tech boat made entirelyout of sponsor materials. Second\\nwas Queens which had a tri-hulldesign and few sponsors, but adedicated team of twenty. Third was\\nWaterloo 2, who had no sponsorsand a very simple design: popbottles glued together in the shape\\nof a canoe; they too had a large teamand, like the teams before them, hada PowerPoint presentation. And\\nlast, but by no means least as youwill soon see, was my teamthe U.of T. team, the smallest but most\\ndedicated team of all. Ours had thesimplest design: a few planks ofwood that, together with fencing,\\nmade a rigid net. On this net, emptypop bottles were very neatlyarranged in the shape of a hemi-\\nellipsoid. The bottles had beenopened the night before to exposethem to cold air so that they\\nwouldnt shrink when they came incontact with the cold lake the nextday. This was covered by more\\nfencing, which was then tightly tiedto the rigid wooden frame. Our boatwas built the night before the race,\\nwhich was the only time most of usdid not have a midterm. (I had aCalculus midterm the next morning\\nat 10:00, and we finished construc-tion of the boat at 6:30.) By nomeans did we have time for a\\nPowerPoint presentation. However,the judges liked our entry, althoughone could see that they were not too\\nsure that the boat would float.The first two teams raced andhad only a little bit of rocking. The\\nthird team, Waterloo 2, could notstartthey could not push off thedock without flipping (they tried\\nthree times in the cold water of LakeOntario). Our boat, to everybodyssurprise, went as smoothly as a\\nswan. Unfortunately, since we onlyhad two rowers (this is how we de-signed the boat) as opposed to the\\nother teams that had three andsince there was a large drag forcecreated by our design, our team had\\nthe longest time. The judges, con-gratulating our valiant effort andseeing how much we learned fromthe experience (we originally triedto make the canoe of out sheets of\\nplastic that we wanted to make bymelting pop bottlesa very difficultthing to do), awarded us third place.\\nThe U. of T. team was composed ofTom Borrowich, Laura Declercq-Lopez, and your humble writer,\\nAlexandru Sonoc.The PopBottle CanoeAlexandru SonocCHEM OT5Halal food is the latest additionon the menu in the SF cafeteria.Students can request Halal meat at\\nthe grill or entree kiosks. Afterprolonged lobbying by the MuslimStudents Association (MSA),\\nSodexho (the main food provider oncampus) began serving Halal itemsat Sidney Smith cafeteria, and then\\nexpanded to Medical Sciences andSanford Fleming Cafeteria, alongwith Wilson Dining Hall (New\\nCollege).Zabiha, the word for the Islamicmethod of slaughtering animals, is\\nscientifically the best and humaneas well. The Islamic mode ofslaughtering an animal requires the\\nfollowing conditions to be met:1.The animal should be slaugh-tered with a sharp object (a\\nknife) and in a fast way so thatthe pain of slaughter is mini-mized.2.The animal should be slaugh-tered by cutting the throat, wind-pipe and the blood vessels in the\\nneck, causing its death withoutcutting the spinal cord.3.The blood should be drainedcompletely before the head isremoved because it serves as agood culture medium for micro-\\norganisms and toxins. The spinalcord must not be cut because thenerve fibres to the heart could be\\ndamaged during the process,causing cardiac arrest andstagnating the blood in the blood\\nvessels. Therefore, the Islamicway of slaughtering is morehygienic as most of the blood\\ncontaining germs, bacteria,toxins, etc. that are the cause ofseveral diseases are eliminated.4.Meat slaughtered the Islamicway remains fresh for a longertime due to a lack of blood in the\\nmeat as compared to othermethods of slaughtering.5.The swift cutting of vessels of theneck disconnects the flow ofHumairah IrfanCOMP OT5Halal Food at SUDSblood to the part of the brain\\nresponsible for pain. Thus, the\\nanimal does not feel pain. Whiledying, the animal struggles,writhes, shakes and kicks, not\\ndue to pain, but due to the con-traction and relaxation ofmuscles deficient in blood and\\ndue to the flow of blood out ofthe body.Halal food began to be served at U.\\nof T. a few years ago as an experi-ment by individual residences.Loretto College for girls at St.\\nMichaels College has been servingHalal meat for a few years now. Lastyear, Burwash Dining Hall (Victoria\\nCollege) began serving Halal meatand still does. This summer,Sodexho approached MSA to see\\nwhat their needs were, because theysaw a potential market for Halalfood on campus. Sodexhos sister\\nbranches in the USA have had greatsuccess with serving Halal food.Lorna Willis has been the Sodexho\\nGeneral Manager since September1999 and is responsible for allcampus locations except Trinity and\\nSt. Mikes. In an interview with her,I learned that Sodexho has receiveda tremendous response, much bet-\\nter than they were expecting, andare very pleased with this. Theinterview follows below:Why did Sodexho feel the need forintroduction Halal food?Sodexhos mission is to createand offer services that contribute toa more pleasant way of life for\\npeople whenever and wherever theycome together. Our role on campusis to provide services that enhance\\nthe quality of student life. Werealized that a significant portion ofour customer base would appreciate\\nthe convenience of being able toaccess Halal products on campus.We began getting requests for Halal\\nproducts about a year- and-a-halfago. It took a while to find suppliersof Halal meats that were approved\\nthrough Sodexhos procurement de-partment. Sodexho has very highstandards for food safety and qual-ity assurance and we audit oursuppliers facilities to ensure that\\nyour food is safe. The program re-ally got a boost when, through Stu-dent Affairs, we met with the Mus-\\nlim Students Association. The MSApresident, Muhammad BasilAhmad, provided valuable instruc-\\ntion on how to properly prepareHalal food. Additionally, the MSAwas very supportive in promoting\\nthe program through their list-serve.How has the response been so far?I would say tremendousmuchbetter than we expected thanks to\\nthe support of the MSA. Nextmonth, I will be making apresentation to other Sodexho\\nmanagers who may want to intro-duce the products on their cam-puses.Do you have any new menu itemsplanned for the future? What is\\nbeing served at the moment?Right now, we are servingburgers, chicken burgers, chicken\\nbreasts, chicken hot dogs, and avariety of lamb products. The itemsare being offered at our grills and\\ndisplay cooking stations. Somelocations offer an entree made withHalal meat. At New College, we\\noffer one entree daily that is Halal(sometimes this is a fish dish).Our first goal was to provide anumber of products and serve themproperly. As we move forward, wewill be preparing more entrees\\nusing Halal meats. It is a challengebecause some of our locations donot have full kitchens. What we\\nhave learned is that there is amarket for the productswithproven volumes; it is easier to find\\nnew products and suppliers.For more information, contact:MSA: www.utoronto.ca/muslimEmail: msa_uoft@yahoogroups.comALEXANDRU SONOC the CANNON12| FEATURESPaul Cadario has led quite theinteresting life. After four years atU. of T. as a CIV, years teeming with\\ninvolvement in student affairs andpolitics, Paul graduated in 1974 witha Rhodes Scholarship. This honour\\ntook him to Englands Oxford Uni-versity, where he studied Philoso-phy, Politics and Economics. In Oc-\\ntober of 75, after completing hisstudies, Paul embarked on a careerat the World Bank. He has since\\nbeen involved in projects spanningthe globe, from Greece to WestAfrica to China. His current position\\ninvolves overseeing the Banks dis-tribution of $1.6 billion USD of do-nors money annually as grants for\\ndevelopment. Paul was kind enoughto give The Cannon his views on anumber of different issues. Here are\\njust some of the topics he covered:On municipal engineeringamong the Inuit in the Cana-dian Arctic (Paul worked thereover a summer):During the 1950s and 1960s,Canadas federal government had\\ngone to a lot of trouble and spent alot of money to concentrate theInuit in settlements, rather than let\\nthem follow their nomadic ways.This left their people in the handsof the government (including the\\nRCMP), the church, and theHudsons Bay Company. Even thenparents and elders were concerned\\nthat their children were growing upwithout understanding their cul-ture, as snowmobiles replaced\\ndogsleds, and canned goods, popand candy replaced fish, caribouand other hunted bounty from the\\nland. A book by Farley Mowat hadhighlighted some of these concerns,probably underplaying the issue of\\nenvironmental sustainability in thelife that was and, looking back atsome of the issues, taking a socially\\nconstructed view of Inuit that,carried to an extreme, would havekept the Inuit (and other First Na-\\ntions in Canadas north) quite apartfrom the 20th century. Students inthe 1970s read it. Anyway, the\\nsettlements had a small number ofwhite families, the nurse, the priest,the teacher, the community admin-\\nistrator and the Bay company per-son, living in modern houses, withfive-gallon flush toilets, requiring,\\nof course, regular trucked watersupply and pumping out of sewage/wastewater holding tanks, all reli-\\nably heated so they wouldnt freeze,while the other 95% of thecommunitys residents, the Inuit,\\nlived in fairly basic pre-built hous-ing, without running water and re-lying on what were called honey-\\nbags to dispose of human waste.The collection of the honey-bagsand their disposal was not as regu-\\nlarly or carefully organized as theservices provided to the non-Inuithouseholds, so that when the snow\\nmelted in the spring, the combina-tion of decaying skinned seals,thawing honey-bags and drainage\\nproblems was quite remarkable toexperience. The work that Profes-sor Gary Heinke (who was later\\nDean) was leading for what wasthen called Indian Affairs andNorthern Development was to ex-\\namine how the overall municipalservices delivery worked, and pro-pose more cost-effective, equitable\\nand environmentally appropriateapproaches to the Federal Govern-ment, who was paying for it all. I\\ntravelled to villages in the centralAlumnus InterAlumnus InterAlumnus InterAlumnus InterAlumnus Intervievievievieview: Pw: Pw: Pw: Pw: Paul Cadarioaul Cadarioaul Cadarioaul Cadarioaul CadarioTarek SaghirCHEM 0T5Arctic during two summers to dothe field research, coming back\\nquite shocked by the inequality andinefficiency of it all. In a way,Canada had its own third-world\\ncountry up north.On Hot Topic issues in the1970s:...to list the issues in late 60sand early 70s, you had, of course,\\nthe Vietnam War (or the AmericanWar as it is called at the museumin Hanoi, which I recently visited\\nwhile there on World Bank busi-ness), Americanization of Canadaand the protection of Canadian cul-\\nture (everything from foreign in-vestment, to buy Canadian, to therole of the multiversity as a servant\\nto the military-industrial complex(a very Cold War construct), towhether there should be a Canadian\\nedition of Time magazine, to thenumber of Americans employed byuniversities as many young academ-\\nics fled the draft, to stopping theSpadina Expressway. Drugs and sexwere then, as now, on the agenda,\\nthough the issues there were calledfeminism/womens liberation,sexual liberation, and the right to\\nchoose (access to birth control andabortion services). Toronto in the70s was not nearly as open, diverse\\nand cosmopolitan as it is today.Gay, lesbian, bisexual andtransgendered rights issues were\\nstill pretty much in the closet, evenin the liberal parts of the universitycommunity, in part because sexism\\nwas still pretty rampant, even oncampus, in those days. Hart Housewas opened to women members\\nonly in my fourth year. The Toikeprinted some pretty raw stuff (noth-ing compared to what happened\\nlater, which led to its reforms).During my time as an undergradu-ate there were protests and sit-ins\\nabout daycare, about undergradu-ate access to the stacks in the then-new Robarts Library, and about\\nparity (of students and faculty) onvarious university governmentbodies that were to be created. (This\\nwas before there was a GoverningCouncil.) I think that then, as now,issues anywhere are driven by a\\nsmall number of committed activ-ists. Today the Internet (a productof engineers) makes it far easier to\\norganize an issue and spread infor-mation about it. But today, thereare a lot more issues competing for\\nattention (eyeballs) so I imaginethat the general level of engagementin social issues is probably about the\\nsame, celebrated protests like Se-attle, Prague, Quebec City andWashington notwithstanding.On the Third World and thefeasibility of debt relief:I just spent some time inBangladesh, my third visit in a de-\\ncade. I came away feeling that de-spite the multi-storey buildings inevery direction on the horizon in\\nDhaka (or, more accurately, theconstruction cranes), the lot of thepoor urban dweller and her family,\\nand particularly her daughters, hadnot improved. When you considerhow most of our lives in Canada and\\nthe United States have changed forthe better in the last 10 years, youcannot but want to do something.Debt relief is one of the tools theinternational community has givenitself as part of the arsenal to fight\\nglobal poverty. The Highly In-debted Poor Countries (HIPC) Ini-tiative, spearheaded by the World\\nBank and the International Mon-etary Fund, and supported by mostdeveloped countries, is the firstcomprehensive international re-sponse to provide debt relief to thepoorest countries. Properly struc-\\ntured and conditioned, debt reliefcan help them spend what they saveon debt service on important social\\nprograms, particularly in health andeducation, and on programs to fightHIV/AIDS. The cut in the global\\nstock of debt also lets countriesprudently borrow new money, sincethe HIPC program also aims to put\\nin place public institutions that canspend wisely on the right public in-vestments, including water supplies\\nand social goods like schools andclinics and their operating costs.Beyond debt relief, though, itwill be vitally important for devel-oped countries to open their bordersto more trade from developing\\ncountries, particularly in agricul-tural products and industrial goodslike clothing, since gains from in-\\ncreased trade will far exceed eventhose from the most generous debtrelief schemes. With global foreign\\ninvestment, and thanks in part tostudent activism, come appropriatelabour and safety standards, prob-\\nably the only way many countriescan end child labour. Its also im-portant that appropriate, well-de-\\nsigned and economically executedand maintained infrastructure,from the rural road to the secure\\ncontainer port, be ready to shipthose goods to market.Microfinance is also an important\\nway to create employment and pro-vide opportunities for small-scaleentrepreneurs and business people,\\nparticularly women.Im not seduced by the hypeover the Internet and the knowledge\\neconomy as being the answer to allthe problems of development. Buta more transparent world where\\nknowledge is freely shared and ex-changed allows the spread of high-value-added work related to com-\\nputers and technology, and someservices, to countries where an edu-cated labour force can do the job\\njust as well and at far lower cost. Italso builds honest, more account-able governments. And above all,\\nknowledge spreads the values ofcompetition, markets and equalitythat underpin the most successful\\neconomies today. Yes, there arerisks in the information age, includ-ing to our privacy and civil liberties.\\nSome are inherent in how complexsystems behave. The risks to indi-viduals and to free societies can best\\nbe addressed by everyone beingmore tolerant of ideas and differ-ences and open to change, and bybeing conscious of the need to make\\nit possible for people everywhere,particularly the very poorest, toshare in the progress that engi-\\nneersand many otherscan makepossible.On education and career pathsfor the next generation of en-gineers:I think that the 21st century be-longs to integrators, and engineers\\nby virtue of both the breadth anddepth of what we study are naturalintegrators. Economics and busi-\\nness are one useful addition, andunderstanding the human andmanagement challenges of organi-\\nzations is becoming more and moreimportant. Engineering and tech-nology will increasingly raise legal\\nissues, and it would be good if someengineers turned their talents inthese directions too, and dont get\\ndragged into suing drunk driversand negotiating M&As, where, alas,the money can be. As a U. of T. grad,\\nand a friend of Skule, I would be re-miss if I did not mention that wehave to have the engineering profes-\\nsors of the future, colleagues whoare at the top of the field and canpush forward the discipline, so I\\nhope that some of the top studentswill go to MIT, or Stanford, or Im-perial College, to advance engineer-\\ning knowledge and come back toCanada to teach and do research.The problems the world has today,\\nparticularly related to the environ-ment, have global consequences,and unless we can grow more food,\\nprovide adequate water, and use en-ergy and other resources on theplanet more judiciously, the human\\nand political consequences are toodreadful to imagine. The physicaland natural sciences are perhaps\\nmore engaged in identifying theproblems, and social scientists lookinto impact and try to quantify it,\\nbut engineering is key to finding andimplementing solutions to the greatproblems of our time.Final quick facts:-If youre in Eng Sci, you will haveprobably written your first yearCIV quizzes in the Cadario Facil-\\nity for Integrated Learning.

After all, the meremention of the word biology isenough to turn many engineeringstudents into pitiful, whimperingcreatures clutching pathetically at\\ntheir hard hats.Not so for Professor PeterZandstra. In 1992, he completed\\nundergraduate studies in ChemicalEngineering in a unique McGillprogram that allows students to\\nstudy engineering and also acquirea minor. Professor Zandstras mi-nor? Biotechnology. After McGill,\\nit was on to the University ofBritish Columbia, where his thesisdealt with the growth of\\nhematopoietic stem cells.Today, Professor Zandstrascore appointment at U. of T. is with\\nthe Institute of Biomaterials andBiomedical Engineering (IBBME),although he is also appointed to\\nChemical Engineering and MedicalBiophysics. His research continuesto focus on stem cells, those little\\nblobs that have been the subject offeatures in TIME magazine, andwhich have biomedical researchers\\ngiddy with excitement.The excitement is warranted.Most cells in your body are dif-ferentiated. They have a certainfunction which they perform, andno other. A liver cell is very good\\nat being a liver cell, for example,but its useless as a brain cell.Stem cells, on the other hand,are undifferentiated. Instead, theyhave the ability to not only repro-duce themselves but also produce\\ndifferentiated cells. Embryonicstem cells, found in the embryos ofdeveloping organisms, can producedifferentiated cells of any variety.\\nAdult stem cells are thought toproduce differentiated cells of onlyone kind (although recent research\\nmay indicate that this is not alwaysthe case).Theoretically, this means thatwe could use stem cells to repairtissue and tissue function in justabout any area of the body. Appli-\\ncations range from organ regenera-tion to the introduction ofcorrective genes, which, thanks to\\nthe ability of stem cells to repro-duce, would not only be producedin adequate quantities, but would\\nalso remain present instead of dis-appearing as cells died.Professor Zandstras lab dealswith two aspects of stem cell re-search. The first is the explorationof cell-fate decisions at a molecu-\\nlar level. This kind of researchwould allow us to control the pro-duction of specific differentiated\\ncells from stem cells. Using thisinformation, his lab is also inter-ested in designing bioprocesses to\\nuse stem cells on a clinically rel-evant scale.Surprisingly (or not, depend-ing on your opinion of the Cana-dian government), research in thisand related fields has gone unregu-\\nlated basically since it began. LastMay, Health Minister AnneMcLellan introduced her attempt\\nto address this with Bill C-56, AnAct Respecting Assisted HumanReproduction. Researchers, bioet-hicists, activists, and even thepublic are calling the bill long over-due.Professor Zandstra predictsthat it will finally provide a direc-tion for many scientists as well as\\naccelerate the pace of research:There are a lot of people, such asmyself, who have kind of beenwaiting for a frameworkWevebeen reticent to just jump in.\\nWhich is completely understand-able. (Hello, Professor So-and-so?Bad news. All of your experiments\\nare about to become illegal. Pleaseterminate your lifes work at yourearliest convenience.)Unfortunately, the govern-ment doesnt have a very good trackrecord in this kind of policy-mak-\\ning. It comes nine years after theRoyal Commissions report on newreproductive technologies, 24 years\\nafter the first test-tube baby, andmore than 30 years after twoToronto researchers were the first\\nto conclusively show the existenceof hematopoeitic stem cells inmice. This bill marks the third timethe Canadian government has triedto legislate reproductive andgenetic technologies.The legislation as it stands nowwould allow for embryonic stemcell research under certain\\nconditions. These include usingcells from human embryos that arethe result of infertility treatments,\\nbut only if the embryos were goingto be discarded, and with the fullconsent of the couples who own the\\nembryos. Researchers who wish touse embryonic stem cells wouldfirst need to apply to a new\\nregulatory body, the AssistedReproduction Agency of Canada.What the legislation will notallow is putting human embryonicstem cells in developmental organ-ismsin other words, in animal\\nembryos. The fear is that thehuman cells will become incorpo-rated into the animal, creating a\\nhybrid or, as Professor Zandstraputs it, an animal-human chi-mera.This invocation of a fire-breathing monster from Greekmythologypart lion, part goat,and part serpentis not simply adramatic image. It is a reminderthat, as is the case with every kind\\nof progress, the enormous poten-tial of stem cells is also their dan-ger.Also clouding the issue, besidesthe political rhetoric floatingaround, is the fact that stem cell\\nresearch is still very new. Manythings are still unclear, includingwhat kind of stem cells will be\\nneeded to develop treatments,much less how to control theirbehaviour, or what long-term ef-\\nfects implanting stem cells willproduce. Stem cell research willgive us the capacity to conceptually\\ndesign treatments for all cell-baseddiseases. But thats sort of a 50-year dream of where we would go,\\nProfessor Zandstra cautions.At the same time, no one is ex-actly pessimistic, either. It would\\nbe very exciting to be involved inthe development of a clinical treat-ment (using stem cells) that would\\nmake a difference in peoples lives,says Professor Zandstra, adding, Ithink thats going to happen soon.Especially as an engineer, Ithink we can help to move [stemcell research] from the phenom-\\nenological, biological sphere to aclinically useful one.1.

Sonys\\nImageStation, for instance, re-\\nquires users to sign up for a free\\naccount before viewing an\\nalbums photos. This is frustrat-\\ning for people looking for quick\\naccess to photographs.The solution is to post photosto a personal website (i.e. our ECF\\nwebspace). This is simplified by\\nWeb Album Generator (available\\nat www.ornj.net), an outstandingpiece of freeware that handles the\\ntedious details of creating a photo\\nwebsite. When the software loads,\\nthe user can add photos to the al-\\nbum. Titles and captions can be\\nadded to the photos as needed. A\\nwizard can then be run to gener-\\nate the web version of this album.The wizard handles everything,including:\\n- Creating thumbnails for your\\nimages;\\n- Resizing the original images\\nto a user-defined size. This is im-\\nportant, as high resolution pho-\\ntos are usually too large to be ef-\\nfectively viewed on-screen;\\n-Designing a layout for your\\nphoto page, with much room for\\ncustomization;\\n-Creating all necessary html\\nfiles and file structures for the\\nwebpage.All that remains is to uploadthe web album onto your\\nwebspace.This software was designedby Mark McIntyre, a computer\\nscience student at the University\\nof Alberta in his final year. Mark\\nwrote the program after a fruit-\\nless search for an album genera-\\ntor. The programs that he did\\nmanage to find had, IE specific\\ntags, ugly JavaScript, non-com-\\npliant HTML source, or some\\nother nasty feature. Mark says,\\nIt was just one of those Argh, Ill\\ndo it myself! moments ... if\\nnecessity is the mother of inven-\\ntion, then inexpressible frustra-\\ntion is the mother of improve-\\nment, I guess.As mentioned, Web AlbumGenerator is freeware, meaningthat Marks only revenue comes\\nfrom donations. The freeware\\nbrings exposure to Marks\\nwebsite, but his costs outweigh\\nhis revenues. When asked if his\\nsoftware was open source, Mark\\nresponded that it was not. The\\nopen source movement has value,\\nbut I really think it depends on\\nthe project, said Mark, com-\\nmenting on the open sourceYou may not realize that there arenormal, totally with it adults in oursociety who are without answeringmachines.

Why should I makeit easy for people reach me? was his\\nonly retort whenever the idea arose.Ding ding ding, doors closing, End ofDiscussion.That all changed when my par-ents went on a five-week-long trip andneglected to tell their insurance\\nbroker.

This seminar is designed to maximize the information available to the group while minimizing the reading that must be done by any one individual. Thus, each week some reading is assigned to all and some is assigned only to several individuals (designated by numbers 1-10). You need only read the abstracts of papers that are not assigned to you. Unfortunately, there is a pervasive tendency for groups to discuss shared information at the expense of information that is privy to only some members (see Wittenbaum & Stasser, 1996). For all of us to benefit from all the information available to us collectively, it is absolutely essential for all seminar participants to pool unshared information in discussion.

Discussion points should be implications raised by the material that suggest controversy, creative connections to other issues, thought experiments, or application of the material anything you think is worth discussing. If any of the readings are assigned specifically to you, two of the discussion points should concern, at least in part, these specific readings. The notes need not be in any particular form but they must reveal thoughtful reflection on the material in fewer than a total of 500 words. Include the date of the class in the header. Bring a copy of your discussion points to class. Papers Prospectus: The prospectus, due September 19, should be a short (two pages max), informal paper that describes the topic for your literature review. Topics should be selected only after discussion with me; please see me in my office at least once by September 17. The prospectus mostly puts down on paper what we agreed upon orally. Topics will be restricted to a review of the empirical literature in areas (a) clearly within the domain of small, task performing groups (b) for which there already exists a substantial body of empirical literature. Topics should be framed in conceptual terms (e.g., intellective tasks versus decision-making tasks) rather than in terms of specific exemplars (e.g., elementary school mathematics groups versus juries). The prospectus should describe what the topic is to be, how and where you expect to find relevant literature, your intended approach in your literature search, and how you might broaden it or narrow it depending on the availability of relevant articles. Include a minimum of five representative references that exemplify the kinds of studies you expect to be reviewing. Please submit two copies. Two points will be deducted from the grade for your literature review for each day the prospectus is late. Once your prospectus is approved, you can begin working on the literature review. Literature Review: A review of the literature on your topic is due October 24. There is a penalty of three points per day for late papers. Include an abstract. The paper should spell out the purpose of the review explicitly and put the topic in context. The heart of the paper should be based on a thorough search, review, summary, and critique of the primary, empirical literature. The review should lead the reader to explicit conclusions about what is known and what needs to be investigated in the research area. The last section may point out, in a general way, directions for future research. You should consult Bem (1995) for excellent advice on how to write a review paper. Normally, such a paper will run 20 to 25 pages. Research Proposal: A research proposal based on your literature review is due November 21. There is a penalty of three points per day for late papers. Papers will not be accepted after December 10. The proposal should include an abstract, a rewritten version (8 pages max) of the literature review that conforms to the style of an empirical article. Include only directly relevant studies, a clear statement of the problem to be investigated, and a ridiculously detailed method section. A paragraph on the proposed statistical analysis of the data should be included, but there should not be Results and Discussion sections. Copies of exact instructions to subjects, all tests, questionnaires, stimulus materials, dependent measures, drawings of equipment if not standard, etc. should be included with the proposal as appendices. Important: The proposal must be something you could actually do (and I hope intend to) without unusual resources or time about what you could invest in a second year project. Points will be deducted for proposals that fail this feasibility test. Format: All papers are to adhere strictly to APA format (APA Publication Manual 5th Edition; if you do not have it, buy it now) and should be submitted in the exact form that they would be in for journal submission except as necessary to meet the requirements of the assignment (e.g., a proposal method section is written in the future tense and does not include results and discussion sections). Proper documentation and citation are essential in scholarship. Anything that might mislead a reasonable reader as to the source of ideas or ways of expressing them is plagiarism and will subject the author to the severest possible penalties. Examinations and Grades The mid-term exam will consist of three essay questions covering the preceding material. The final exam will include three questions over the last section of the course and one general question about the broader issues raised during the term. Questions for the mid-term exams will be available at 4:00 p.m. on October 14 and answers must be turned in before 11:00 a.m. on October 16. Questions for the final exam will be available at 10:00 a.m. on December 15 and answers must be turned in before 10:00 a.m. on December 17. A request to change the day/time of the exams will not be considered unless it is agreed to unanimously by every member of the seminar. You may use published material and your own notes in answering the questions. Once the exam questions are released, any form of collaboration with anyone is absolutely and strictly prohibited. Final grade: Prospectus (P/F), Mid-term exam (15%), Final exam (20%), Literature review (30%), Research proposal (20%), and discussion points and class participation, (15%). Note: Any student who requires special arrangements to meet course requirements should contact me as soon as possible so that accommodations can be made. Please present appropriate verification from Disabled Student Services, Dean of Students Office. References Allwood, C. M., & Granhag, P. A. (1996).

      "[\"\\nSYLLABUS - ANTH 4050/5053 QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN ANTHROPOLOGY Spring 2006 - MW 4:00-5:15\\nInstructor: Dr. Tammy Stone Office: CU building, office 110P\\nPhone 556-3063; e-mail Tammy.Stone@cudenver.edu Office Hours: by appointment Required Text books: Kachigan, Sam K. Multivariate Statistical Analysis (second edition). Radius Press, New York. Salkind, Neil J. 2004\\nStatistics for People who Think They Hate Statistics (second edition). Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA. Additional Supplies: You will need at least one floppy disk formatted for an IBM computer. You will use this disk to copy the data set on to for each home work assignment, as well as your results, and your write ups. Nothing may be saved on the hard drive of the computer network. You should note, however, that all data sets are copyright protected and may not be used in publications with out permission and appropriate citations. Grades: Undergraduates: Your grade will be based on 10 equally weighted homework assignments; the lowest grade of the 10 will be dropped. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of class of the assigned date - they will be the topic of discussion for at least part of the class in which they are due. The due dates listed in this syllabus are approximate and may be modified based on the pace of the class. Due dates will be listed on each homework assignment as it is handed out. Homework assignments are considered late after the end of the class listed on the handout. They will be accepted late for credit if handed in before the start of the next class. Homework grades are based on the quality of the analysis of the data and the quality of the argument that is made concerning the anthropological question. You should be thorough in answering all questions posed in the problem sets. For homework 3 through 10, you should write up your results as though they were a technical paper that will be incorporated in a published report with the appropriate references to supporting tables and figures. Do not put forward conclusions your data can not support in these papers. Homework may be hand written, as long as, in my judgment, your handwriting is neat and easily readable. The figures and tables need not be publication quality, but they should be clear and well-labeled. Graduate Students: Your grade will be based on the 10 homework assignments (see description above) and an additional assignment, all equally weighted. The additional assignment will be carried out on an independent data set of your choosing in which you decide the question to be asked, the test to be used to answer that question, and a 2 to 5 page write up describing the question, the data, the test, the results and your conclusions. Appropriate citations (i.e., data sources if not your own, background on question, etc) must be made in American Antiquity or American Anthropologist format. This assignment is due at 4:00 pm 5/10 - you may hand them in early if you wish. Notes on Class: Due to University policy, the following deadlines will be strictly enforced: Spring 2006 Registration and Academic Deadlines CLAS students must always have an accurate mailing and e-mail address: http:/www.cudenver.edu/registrar Students are responsible for completing financial arrangements with financial aid, family, scholarships, etc. January 12, 2006 (5:00 pm) Payment plan deadline for students registering by December 16, 2005.

Consult the Academic Calendar for details on registration/payment deadlines: http://www.cudenver.edu/registrar This class is intended as an intensive introduction to the use of quantitative methods in anthropology. Basic concepts are discussed with an emphasis on the role of quantitative methods in solving problems (i.e., it will be an applied class and little information on theoretical mathematics will be presented). The objectives of this class are four fold 1) to provide a working knowledge of the statistical methods used in anthropological research (i.e., to get you to stop skipping the quantitative sections of the articles you read for class) 2) to discus the types of problems that can be addressed using quantitative methods 3) to provide the background that will allow you to design research projects using quantitative analysis. 4) to familiarize you with the integration of data in reports and the appropriate way to present and reference your results. No prior knowledge or use of computers or statistics is required and I will present the information as though that is the case. Additionally, while the time requirement for the class is not substantial, work must be done on schedule. That is, do not skip a section assuming you will pick it up later. Once you get behind, it is very difficult to catch up.\\nThe class will use the SPSSPC for windows statistical package on IBM computers which is on the network in the social science computing lab (North Classroom 2028). You may use other statistical packages if you wish but data sets will be set up for SPSSPC and other packages will not be discussed in class. Additionally, since the format of output statements vary considerably from package to package, use special care in recording and interpreting your answers. The use of calculators and slide rulers are allowed for aspects of homework to be done by hand (i.e., not by computer). In performing calculations, use the following rules of thumb regarding numerical accuracy: intermediate results which are recorded for later addition or subtraction in a formula should contain as many fractional digits as the basic data contains, but never fewer than 2 such digits. Intermediate quantities recorded for later multiplication or division in a formula should contain twice as many fractional digits as those to be used for addition or subtraction. If in doubt, retain more fractional digits.

The first is Cragg\\'s Castle; the second is History 17A Online Classes -- Fall 2004 on PageOut, and the third is the American History: A Survey textbook study center. Please bookmark all three for easy access. Required Texts: Allan Brinkley, American History: A Survey, 11th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2003. There is a direct web page for more information and study materials for this text. Access the online study center directly for the student learning center, which contains sample quizzes, sample essays, and a lot more. Howard Zinn, A Peoples History of the United States, Harper-Collins, 2003.There are several websites discussing Professor Zinn\\'s views and politics.\\nOrientation: This class, which is an Internet-based, distance education course, will be conducted completely online.\\nThe Internet: This Internet Online course utilizes the Internet extensively and requires the student to have a working knowledge of computers, email, word processors, and the use of printers or, at the very least, the willingness to learn about these technologies quickly. Your computer should be well equipped with at least a Pentium 4 processor and a reliable email system. In addition to your own computer, you should have a back-up plan for using another computer when yours is not operating correctly. Other locations now include almost all public libraries. You should have a recent MS Word application on your computer in order to send your assignments as email attachments. AOL Users: Be aware that for whatever reasons, AOL isn\\'t the most stable system and students in the past have had some difficulties both taking exams and communicating with me. Your first assignment on the Internet will be to send an email to drcragg@craggs-castle.com indicating your real last name, Hist17A Online, and then the reason why you are writing in the Subject line. (This is the \"Subject Line Protocol\" required of ALL email correspondence for any reason throughout the semester.) For example, Jones, Hist 17A Online, First Communication, in the subject line. In the first message, please send your full name, why you\\'re taking this class and something about yourself, such as what high school you attended, previous college work, year in college, family, et cetera. For your second assignment, you will be required to register for this course from the McGraw-Hill PageOut link in addition to your registration with the college. The login procedure will ask you to submit a user id name and a password. Please use your last name and first name in one word, for example SmithJoan. You will be able to access your grades, your assignments, and the use of a closed discussion area to communicate with the instructor and other members of the classes from PageOut. There is a third assignment from the PageOut Grade Book to see if our communication link has been established prior to taking the first online multiple choice exam. You should take the Testing the Test System m/c exam as soon as possible. Please note the due date. Complete the assignments, send an email message, register on PageOut, and send the Testing the System m/c exam as soon as possible after the first day of classes and by the end of the first week.These connections are also described at the online orientation as well. A lot of your learning will be from a variety of Internet online resources and an assigned textbook. There is a link on Cragg\\'s Castle, History 17A Online Class, to the Hist 17A Online Message Center, which will be used frequently to inform students about everything from due dates, to updates, to future assignments. There is also a link called, Cool News and Information. These web page links are often related to the textbook readings, or just plain historical and political issues with a twist. There is a weekly student opinion poll that I hope you will use, too. Check the Hist 17A Online Opening Page often, too, for additional information. You should get in the habit of \"checking in\" regularly, perhaps daily, for email and online activities as a consequence of fast breaking news and current events related to our study of American history.\\nReadings: This course is designed around the writings of two well-known historians and their impressions on what happened in the early history of the United States, often with widely divergent views. The following chapters of the textbook will also be used for testing. Chapters 1-15 in Blinkley and appropriate matching chapters in Zinn. Testing: There will be a variety of testing in this course. First, there will be five essay examinations. These essay exams will be writing exercises covering textbook materials and online resources. Each exam will contain two to four essay questions from the textbooks. The questions will usually be posted on a Friday and you will have until Tuesday at 5:00 pm to submit them as an MS Word document attachment. This online class will emphasize textbook materials and Internet research in the testing and evaluation process. See your PageOut Grade Book for all assignments and the exam dates. There will be no essay exam make-ups. Second, there will be twelve online multiple choice exams of multiple questions each due approximately every Thursday. (See your PageOut Grade Book for due dates.) The quizzes are designed to assist you in keeping up with the reading from the textbooks. They are open book and can be submitted at any time prior to the due date. You will have, however, only one chance to submit your results. You can read the questions, close the web page, study the textbook, and open the m/c exam any number of times until you\\'re ready to submit your answers, which is the one that counts in the Grade Book. Follow the instructions on how to take the m/c exams and how to submit them to your Grade Book in PageOut by completing the first Testing the Test System exercise. No m/c exams will be accepted after the due dates. Third, as a research project for the semester, you are asked to collect ten different political cartoons by at least five different artists (two per theme) on five different historical eras or themes of your choice representing the events in American history up to 1877 of interest to you. You should send this assignment to me by email using an attached MS Word document. As a part of your research assignment, you should indicate clearly what five historical events or eras you have chosen, why you chose them, and describe for your reader in your own words who the artist is, what the cartoon says, who the intended audience might have been, and whether or not it was, in your opinion, effective. Be sure to cite your sources. Do not use any materials from our two textbooks as they are fairly well documented. See your Grade Book for the due date. No exams or assignments will be accepted after the due dates and times.\\nGrading: A distribution will be used to grade each of the evaluation tools: 90% or better will be an A; 89-80% will be a B; 79-70% will be a C; 69-65% will be a D, while any percentage below 64% will be an F. A word is in order about the academic vice known as \"plagiarism.\" There is a college rule prohibiting the use of others\\' materials in exams, papers, and research projects without proper citations. For an interesting article about plagiarism, read what one English professor has to say about her experiences dealing with it. Automatic failure in the course for those found cheating on their writing assignments.\\nParticipation: There is a strong correlation, in my judgment, between participation and grades, so make a commitment to your education and try your very best to participate in all course activities. Be engaged in your own intellectual development. Should you contemplate dropping this class, please check with me first to see if there are any interventions possible to help you stay in school. Protect your transcript as this is one of the very few documents that will follow you for the rest of your life.\\nFinal Grades: While everyone likes to know what their letter grades are as the semester moves forward, the percentage of completion is more important in calculating a final grade. A final grade will be calculated on the following basis:\\nTwelve Online M/C Quizzes - 360 points; Five essay exercises -- 500 points; and, Historical cartoon research paper -- 140 points.\\nPersonal Note: Lets have a great semester together!

Just wanted to let you know I graduated last year from a university from India.I was just an average hard working student(just like the most of you).OK the sore I received stated 222/90.It may not be an earth shattering score but I\\'m nevertheless thankful as it could have been lower.Preparation for the exam is far far tougher than actually sitting and giving the exam.Since I am familiar with the medical background involved in Asia and also what British Medicine says(in Malaysia British Medical books are preffered)it was quite tough to reorientate myself to the language and style of the USMLE.While the disease are the same but there is alot of difference between this side of the world and whats seen in the US.I studied for over 6months to prepare for the exam.Despite the last minute jitters(I was crying before the exam as I couldn\\'t remember a thing the evening before the exam.....(I guess I was just stressed out)I stuck to my 1st of december to give the exam. OK my preparations: Pathology:Webprep and BRS Anatomy:High Yield gross anatomy and Webprep Embryology:High Yield and webprep Neuroanatomy:Webprep Biochem:webprep+kaplan notes Genetics:High Yield.webprep,Kaplan notes Immunology:Kaplan notes Micobio.:Kaplan notes and webprep Pahrmacology:First Aid,webprep and also gold standard Physiology:Kaplan notes and BRS Behavioural science:High Yield and Kaplan notes I am a slow reader and to go through 1 cycle of reading it took 3months. I also heard Goljan lectures and even went through his notes........I stopped reading his lenghten notes(approx.400pages with general+systemic Pathology)mainly because it was all point form and I don\\'t really like this format.I just went through some of his High Yield one(about 20dd pages).The lectures are informative but not enough to pass the exam.After the exam I went through his High Yield and found it would not have been much beneficial as nothing from those notes was even close to being tested on my exam. I can\\'t remember facts if they are in point form and that why I had to look for alternative reading materials.......this is one of the disadvantages I found with Kaplan as some of them are in point form.My weakest subject is/was pharmacology hence the different materials used to prepare for it.I could not understand a word of neuroanatomy and so only relied on the webprep lectures for it. I think it is pointless to discuss the type of questions and their distribtutions however I feel all subjects had an equal say.First aid is adequate for Microbio. and Pharmacology.But then I didn\\'t really use First Aid apart for Pharmacology and a quick revision for Physiology mainly because First Aid is just too compact My Qbank scores ranged from 70-80% with an average of 74%......I found the questions on the exam nothing like Qbank.Closest was the USMLE CDs......for which I scored 34,38,35.NMBE didnt do. I also did alot of BSS.......though its not similar to the actual exam but for some reason the phrases and facts mentioned in the explanations are the exact stuff what Dr. Goljan mentions on his audio lectures. The questions on the exam were very basic and the language used too very simple however the concepts tested on the exam were so,so basic it seemed hard to determine what the question was even asking at times! Though I slept early the night before the exam(as mentioned I broke down and from that point despite I couldn\\'t remember a thing I decided it was enough and time to close the book as I was just making myself more stessed)however throughout t he night I kept on waking up because some irresponsible people were playing firecrackers all the way till 4am!! I wasn\\'t as fresh on the morning of the exam but still I manged to pull through the 7odd hours.I even realised I made some stupid mistakes but only when the block time was over.Time is ofthe essence and I was basically finishing my blocks with just 3-4min. to spare.Most questions were moderate inlenght and lots of figures....the pharmac. figures were not clear at all and the worst. I just hope my performance for step 2 doesn\\'t slip.I\\'m interested in only Internal Medicine or Pathology.....don\\'t really have any interest in the surgical fields or any other field for that matter .How do you think I stand so far?? If there are any queries I will try to answer them as honestly as possible.All the best to those awaiting results and preparing for the step 1. I will seriously start my USMLE step 2 in February and though I will be frequenting the step 2 forums on this website frequently it will be under a different username as I want to start everything fresh.

MalaysianForum Guru\\nTopics: 28Posts: 778\\n01/05/05 - 03:28 AM #10 The USMLE CD scores were 3weeks prior to the exam. I have worked in a molecular biology lab. before.......I used to learn how to do PCR,Southern blot and hybridization,electrophoresis and had to clean the lab. stuffs via autoclaving and hot oven. To an extent it does help but only in getting familiar with the terminology and the principal behind the procedure but in answering the questions it didn\\'t much....for example while in the lab. I knew PCR is to amplify small DNA fragments....but PCR is tested to detect HIV,Hep. B,myco. TB etc....was not stressed.The lab. based questions I got for the USMLE were very confusing......and most of the time I was looking for answers \\'it doesn\\'t make any sense\\' but didn\\'t quite see them!Since you\\'re working against time and have only those few precious minutes at the end of the block you don\\'t time to analyze compltely and just have to go with your instincts......plus your heart is racing away at the end of the block trying to go through all the questions you marked but all you see is words and your brain freezes! To jigi......it took me over 6months to prepare there are people who take 3-4months and some 9-12months.I guess the time difference is mainly depends on how familiar are you with the USMLE syllabus and how much time you can dedicate a day to sit down and study....its a very subjective thing.....however NMBE conducts tests to let you know how well prepared you actually are....you have to pay US45 and its something I didn\\'t do. Webprep is Kaplan preparation where notes/audio lectures are given via the internet.In malaysia they don\\'t conduct any Kaplan courses and so this was my only option. kaash110Forum Senior\\nTopics: 17Posts: 57\\n01/06/05 - 07:12 AM #11 hi malayisian if u can send us goljan 100pages i\\'ll be grateful thanx huma110jaf@yahoo.com___________________kaash MalaysianForum Guru\\nTopics: 28Posts: 778\\n01/06/05 - 07:25 AM #12 I will send it to you kaash......because I learnt from your posts while preparing for my exam.So its the least I can do.However I\\'m sorry this is first and last person so no more requests pls. from anyone else!!!

The increased overall popularity of the more recent William Gibson novels ( as opposed to Neuromancer, whose popularity was more of a word-of-mouth cult hit ) may be due to this; however, speaking personally, I found the contemporary world of Pattern Recognition less compelling. katashitakashi\\'s blog\\n3 comments\\nRead more natural vs. unnatural in neuromancer By surrealistic - Posted on 6 February 2008 - 9:46am.\\nTagged: Neuromancer\\nResponse 2 Plot-wise, Neuromancer is probably one of the most convoluted books that I have ever read.

What is perhaps most interesting in this detailed description is the attention Gibson pays to material. Scarcely a page goes by without some mention of a plastic window, a silk futon, a leather jacket, denim pants, or a fiberglass chassis. A large part of what creates the futuristic sense of Gibsons world is the development of new materials and the unfamiliar hierarchy of materials, consisting of both the new and the jarringly familiar substances. This hierarchy of material breaks down to two separate categories: body modification and environment. blacklace\\'s blog\\n1 comment\\nRead more Techno-Eden?

Many of the characters make us question our assumptions of what it means to be alive, from the unembodied mind of Wintermute to the mindless body of Armitage, with multiple characters straddling the line between life and death at any given point. Case is the one character who we are really allowed to connect with on any psychological level (though even that hold is tenuous, given the somewhat schizophrenic style of postmodern/cyberpunk writing). amandejoie\\'s blog\\nLogin to post comments\\nRead more 12next last course info\\nrace, gender, and science fiction is the fall 2007 course website for english 168 at pomona college in claremont, california.\\nthe professor\\nthe syllabus\\nmore information tags\\nbugs\\ncourse info\\ngender\\nLilith\\'s Brood\\nMidnight Robber\\nmovie\\nNeuromancer\\nOryx and Crake\\nPattern Recognition\\nrace\\nresponse\\nResponse 1\\nResponse 2\\nResponse 3\\nResponse 4\\nresponse 5\\nResponse 6\\nResponse 7\\nResponse 8\\nSlow River\\nSnow Crash\\nStarship Troopers\\ntest\\nthe handmaid\\'s tale\\nThe Left Hand of Darkness\\nmore tags User login Username: * Password: * Request new password Navigation Recent posts\\nNews aggregator Recent comments\\nLimits of Sci-Fi1 week 21 hours agoambivalent1 week 1 day agoMore humanity1 week 1 day agoI also agree, to a point.1 week 1 day agoI kind of have to agree.

Faculty promote academic integrity in multiple ways including instruction on the components of academic honesty, as well as abiding by university policy on penalties for cheating and plagiarism. Definition of Academic Dishonesty Academic dishonesty includes both cheating and plagiarism. Cheating includes but is not limited to (1) using or attempting to use unauthorized materials to aid in achieving a better grade on a component of a class; (2) the falsification or invention of any information, including citations, on an assigned exercise; and/or (3) helping or attempting to help another in an act of cheating or plagiarism. Plagiarism is presenting the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own. Examples of plagiarism are (1) submitting an assignment as if it were rce or giving the author due credit. Please read the complete policy at www.sfasu.edu/policies/academicintegrity.asp Withheld Grades Semester Grades Policy (A-54) Ordinarily, at the discretion of the instructor of record and with the approval of the academic chair/director, a grade of WH will be assigned only if the student cannot complete the course work because of unavoidable circumstances. Students must complete the work within one calendar year from the end of the semester in which they receive a WH, or the grade automatically becomes an F. If students register for the same course in future terms the WH will automatically become an F and will be counted as a repeated course for the purpose of computing the grade point average. Undergraduate Teacher Certification contains all policies and procedures related to undergraduate teacher certification. Teacher education candidates are responsible to know and understand the policies and procedures outlined in this handbook. The handbook may be viewed and / or downloaded at the COE website: click on IX. Other Relevant Course Information: 1. Use of Cell Phones in class cell phone use or scrutiny is prohibited in class. Under no circumstances will cell phones be tolerated during regular course time. Just as in the public school environment where cell phone usage in class would be considered a sign of disrespect and a distraction (not to mention a hindrance to learning), so shall their presence be viewed in your internship class. As such, cell phone use or incident of incoming calls will result in the loss 2. Candidate Late Work any assignment submitted late will automatically receive a 50 percent reduction in value. Assignments more than one week late will not be accepted. This is regrettable in that it is recognized that candidates lead active and sometimes stressful lives but assignments are structured to coincide with ongoing course activity, thus timeliness is relevant to facilitate professional growth as well as to enhance content understanding.

The 1st Fighter Squadron was constituted on Oct. 5, 1944 and activated as part of the 413th Fighter Group on Oct. 15, 1945. During World War II, the squadron flew P-47 Thunderbolts. On an island near Okinawa the 1st launched P-47s against the Japanese, amassing almost 1,200 combat air patrol, bombing, strafing and escort missions. It was during this era, the squadron adopted its world-renowned emblem, Miss Fury. The 1st Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 1st Fighter-Day Squadron on Aug. 26, 1954 and activated as part of the 413th Fighter-Day Wing on Nov. 11, 1954. Then, on July 1, 1958, the squadron was subsequently named the 1st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron as part of the 413th Tactical Fighter Wing. During this time the squadron trained fighter pilots in the F-86 Sabre from 1954-1956 and the F-100 Super Sabre from 1956-1959. The 1st Tactical Fighting Training Squadron operated out of George AFB, Calif., until it was again deactivated on March 15, 1959 with then Lt. Col. Charles E. Chuck Yeager as commander. On Jan. 1, 1984, the squadron was reactivated as the 1st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, part of the 325th Tactical Training Wing at Tyndall. The 1st TFTS was activated in order to train fighter pilots in the F-15 Eagle. On Sept. 17, 1991, due to a major Air Force reorganization, the operations and maintenance functions of the 1st FS formed one combined squadron. Thus the squadron was renamed the 1st Fighter Squadron. The 1st FS is proud of its long, distinguished heritage and traditions, which have been upheld in defense of American freedom and ideals. (^top of section) 2nd Fighter Squadron Building 446, (850) 283-2904 The 2nd Fighter Squadron, known as the American Beagle Squadron, began its long and distinguished history in January 1941 when it was activated as the 2nd Pursuit Squadron. In 1942, the squadron was redesigned as the 2nd Fighter Squadron. In the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, the squadron flew the Supermarine Spitfire MkIV and the P-51 Mustang, producing 11 fighter aces and achieving 183 aerial victories, the last which was a German jet bomber. During the Cold War the 2nd FS flew a number of interceptor aircraft until transitioning to the F-15 Eagle in 1984. In 1984, the squadron became the 2nd Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, and in 1991 it was redesignated the 2nd Fighter Squadron. During Operation DESERT STORM, 2nd FS graduates accounted for 11 of 35 aerial victories True testimonies to the level of training student pilots receive at Tyndall. Today, the 2nd FS flies the F-15 and is charged with providing near mission ready F-15 pilots for worldwide assignment. Tasked with producing the finest Air Dominance pilots in the world, the 2nd FS carries on its proud heritage of being Second to None. (^top of section) 95th Fighter Squadron Building 164, (850) 283-2121 Known proudly as the Boneheads, the 95th Fighter Squadron has a proud and distinguished history that began in 1942. The squadron first saw service flying the original twin-tailed fighter, the P-38 Lightning, serving in both North Africa and Italy. Among the squadrons many notable accomplishments was its (^top of section) participation in the attacks on the Ploesti oil refineries. Each aircraft carried a 1,000-pound bomb and a 300-gallon gas tank. The unit was credited with delivering its bombs right on target. In May of 1943, the squadron was tasked with the mission of bombing the Island of Pantellaria, a key stepping-stone to the Allied advance. It accomplished the mission with perfection, causing the Islands garrison to surrender just prior to the Allies landing on the Island. The squadron also took part in some of the first shuttle missions to Russia. The 95th FS finished the war with more than 400 kills, 199 air-to-air kills and seven aces. During the post-war period, the squadron was assigned to the Alaskan Air Command, flying the P-51 Mustang. In the fall of 1959, the 95th FS was tasked with the defense of Washington, D.C., and the surrounding area and performed its mission flawlessly. With the initiation of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the threat of manned bomber attacks, the squadron was assigned to 24-hour alert status. Armed with the worlds fastest interceptor, the F-106 Delta Dart, the 95th FS could be called to action and within minutes be airborne fully loaded and armed with nuclear missiles. The present squadron was activated at Tyndall on Aug. 15, 1974, as the 95th Interceptor Training Squadron, redesignated the 95th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron on April 1, 1974, and finally as the 95th Fighter Squadron on Nov. 1, 1991. During the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 95th FS leapt into action by generating combat-configured F-15C aircraft and flying combat air patrol missions over cities in the southeastern United States. The squadrons mascot, Mr. Bones, is pictured on the unit patch on a blue disc with wide yellow border signifying the squadrons dauntless capability to accomplish the mission in any weather, day or night; primarily stalking the enemy to destruction. The full dress, particularly the top hat, depicted on Mr. Bones represents the squadron personnels sentiments that the unit is tops, thus, explaining the squadron motto, Death With Finesse. (^top of section) 43rd Fighter Squadron Building 290, (850) 282-4300 The 43rd Fighter Squadron is one of the oldest active squadrons in the Air Force. The unit was originally activated June 13, 1917 as the 43rd Aero Squadron, at Camp Kelly, Texas. During the 1920s the squadron operated the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field before being deactivated in 1936. The squadron was reactivated in 1940 as the 43rd Pursuit Squadron. Though they never saw combat in either World War, they were in France during the closing days of WWI and tasked with homeland defense in the Panama Canal Zone during World War II, when the threat of an attack on the contiguous 48 states seemed very possible. The unit did see combat during the conflict in Vietnam, flying F-4 Phantoms over South Vietnam. From 1970-1994, the 43rd FS was tasked with air defense once again, this time in the Cold War theater of Alaska. Ultimately, the unit was the recipient of 11 Distinguished Unit Citations. The unit was deactivated in 1994, and reactivated at Tyndall on October 25, 2002. The squadron is tasked with flying and training in the F/A-22 Air Dominance fighter and attack aircraft, the most advanced military aircraft in the world. The 43rd FS is the first F/A-22 flying squadron at Tyndall, and the first operational F/A-22 squadron in the world. (^top of section) 325th Air Controll Squadron Building 1281, (850) 283-2248 The Screaming Eagles began as the 325th Fighter Control Squadron in April 1943. In December 1943, the unit moved to North Africa to support the operations of the 325th Fighter Wing and other American and allied flying units. Moving its radar with the front lines, the squadron saw action throughout the Mediterranean and Southern Europe and earned battle streamers for Rome, 1944; Southern France, 1944; and the Rhineland, 1945. The squadron was disbanded in early 1945, when German air activity had effectively ceased. The present squadron was activated at Tyndall in 1947, making it the bases oldest surviving resident. During the past 54 years the squadron has taught radar operations and maintenance to tens of thousands of personnel of all ranks. Today, the school teaches five primary courses. Officers attend the nine-month Air Battle Manager course. During the course, they learn doctrine, radar theory, surveillance operations, basic fighter control using simulated aircraft, contract-flown MU-2 aircraft and 325th FW F-15s, as well as wartime E-3 operations and joint tactical operations. Graduates go on to fly in the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System or E-8 Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System aircraft.

Readings will include Gilgamesh, The Iliad, Medea, The Ramayana of Valmiki, \"The Story of Joseph\" (Old Testament) , Dante\\'s Divine Comedy, Marie de France\\'s Eliduc, The Thousand and One Nights, Boccaccio\\'s Decameron, Marguerite de Navarre\\'s Heptameron, and Cervantes\\' Don Quixote. Class discussions, combined with reading and writing assignments, will focus on major themes in these works and the ways in which these works reflect the cultures and time periods in which they were created. WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING STANDARDS\\nYou\\'ll be expected to write two long papers in this course, each at least 1500 words in length. In addition, you\\'ll be writing two short papers (each about 500 words) and will be responsible for participating (in class) in a discussion of two assigned works.(The short papers will deal with the same works you\\'ll be preparing for the class discussions). There will also be a number of \"worksheets\" which you will be expected to complete. The first long paper is due on Oct. 22; the second long paper is due on Dec.14. First class discussion and short paper: 15% First long paper: 30% Second class discussion and short paper: 15% Second long paper: 30% Class participation, attendance, and completion of all worksheets and other assignments: 10% Both long papers must be submitted in order for you to receive a grade higher than \"D\" in the course. In regard to the class discussions and short papers, if you are unable to be in class on the date when you are assigned to participate in a class discussion or submit a short paper, you should be sure to contact me to see if another assignment can be substituted; otherwise you\\'ll receive a \"zero\" for the assignment. GROUP WORK\\nAt the beginning of this course, you\\'ll be assigned to a \"group.\" As a member of the group, you\\'ll be expected to participate in helping to lead the class discussion on two occasions. (The exact dates will be given to you and will be indicated in the syllabus.) You\\'ll also be expected to submit a short paper one week after your group has led the discussion. Topics for the short paper will be given at the end of the study guide for the work which your group will be discussing. Group participation is a required part of this course. You must be in class and ready to help lead the discussion on the date assigned. If you miss class on that date, you will have to lead the discussion on a future date. Your short papers will not be accepted if you have not been in class on the day of the group discussion. A percentage of your grade for each short paper will be based on the effectiveness of your work as part of the group. WORKSHEETS\\nTo aid you in doing the readings, you\\'ll be given a \"Study Guide\" for each reading assignment. Paper topics for assigned groups will be included at the ends of the Study Guides. Most of the time, reading assignments will include doing a \"Worksheet\" which will be attached to the Study Guide.\\nWorksheets are due on the date indicated. They may be handed in up to two weeks after the due date for partial credit. ATTENDANCE Regular class attendance is required. If you are forced to miss a class, be sure to contact me to find out what you have missed. Students who miss more than five classes without having discussed reasons for absence with me (and making up missing work) will have their grades lowered by one full grade. Students with more than seven unexcused absences will have their grades lowered by two full grades. A grade no higher than \"D\" will be given to anyone with more than eight unexcused absences. I reserve the right to decide whether or not an absence will be excused. Class participation is essential. If you are forced to miss a class, be sure to contact me to find out what you have missed. You are expected to come to class having done the readings for that day and ready to participate in class discussion. Class participation will count toward the final grade; attendance will also be considered. You are responsible for all readings discussed and assignments due even if you are absent from class. If you must miss class for any length of time, be sure to notify me. During the first six weeks of class, students who do not attend class for three consecutive weeks without contacting me will be withdrawn from the class. After Nov. 2, a grade of \"W\" will be given only if a valid reason for withdrawal is provided. Students who stop attending without notifying me of the reason for withdrawal will receive a grade of \"F\" in the course. LATE PAPERS\\nAssignments must be submitted on the date indicated. A full grade on the paper will be deducted if the paper is late. Papers that are two class periods late will have two grades deducted, those that are three class periods late will have three deducted, etc. Some allowance may be made for special circumstances (illness, etc.) but I reserve the right to make the decision as to whether or not a late paper may be excused. Please note that both of the long papers must be submitted in order for you to receive a passing grade in the course. If a short paper is not submitted, the grade for that paper will be averaged in as a \"zero.\" USE OF SECONDARY SOURCES\\nAll of your writing in this course is expected to be your own work. No outside readings will be expected or required (though I\\'ll be happy to recommend additional readings if you\\'re interested). When you\\'re writing a paper, you must provide documentation for any information derived from a source. This includes use of the Internet. Failure to acknowledge sources (including editors\\' introductions in your textbook) will be regarded as plagiarism. Please do not use Cliff\\'s Notes or similar \"study guides.\" Use of these sources, especially without acknowledgment, will be treated as plagiarism and will be severely penalized. I\\'ll be providing you with my own study guides for all the readings; this is all you should use. Class study guides and worksheets for future assignments will usually be distributed at the beginning of class. If you arrive late, be sure to ask me (later) for any material I may have distributed. MANUSCRIPT FORM\\nYour papers should be neatly typed. When submitting your papers, please follow these guidelines: Leave at least a 1 1/2 inch margin on the left side and a 1 inch margin on the right side. Be sure to double space. Number your pages. Staple pages together or use a paper clip. Be sure the print is dark enough to read easily. Use 12-point print.. All papers should be carefully proofread and neatly corrected. All \"typos\" will be treated as spelling or grammatical errors. NOTE: If any changes must be made in the syllabus or in the reading/writing assignments, you\\'ll be notified in advance.

Jump Now! (Or Later.) (Or Climb Down Slowly.)\\nThe Usefulness of Scholarship Colonial Africa: A List of Questions I think Ive hit on a catchy structure for a modest reshuffling of my Honors seminar in Colonial Africa. Much of my reading list will remain the same, but this restructuring is designed to make the way I look at the historiography much more concrete and transparent to the students. Basically, I want to organize the syllabus in terms of what strike me as the Big Questions that sustain historical and anthropological study of the colonial and postcolonial periods. Im not sure that for each week theres a single major book or article that will frame an answer to the question: these questions operate at different scales and with different degrees of historiographical density. Im curious to hear whether there are other questions youd add to the list, or variant formulations of them that you prefer. Keep in mind that one thing I really want to explore in my seminar is the metaquestion of whether colonialism per se was important or powerful in shaping 20th Century Africa. I want to stay open to the school of thought that suggests that there are other transformative influences that have been far more powerful (capitalism, modernity), to the school of thought that suggests that its actually the prior integration of African societies into global structures between 1450 and 1850 thats more powerful, and to the school of thought that suggests that deep indigenous structures (political, environmental, social, cultural) remain more determinative of daily life and social outcomes in contemporary African societies than influences from the past century. A lot of these questions can be answered well with skeptical reformulations. E.g., you could say in response to the question, Why were European societies able to subject African societies to formal colonial rule with such rapidity? that they werent able to do so, that the colonial state had little real authority outside of administrative centers for twenty or thirty years after lines were drawn on the map in Berlin, save for occasional displays of spectacular violence.\\nThe more I think about it, the more I think that this list would also make a great premise for a catchy short book of essays. Im feeling kind of pulled by the idea. This is kind of my worst habit, thinking of ideas for books rather than finishing almost-done ones, but I cant really help myself. What was the state of African societies in 1860? Are there any useful generalizations to be made in response to that question? What was the relationship between African societies and larger global economic and political systems in 1860?\\nWhy did the Scramble for Africa happen? Why were European societies able to subject African societies to formal colonial rule with such rapidity?\\nDid the activities and character of global capitalism within Africa change markedly after the Scramble for Africa, and was that a consequence of colonialism if so?\\nDid colonial authorities exercise meaningful political and social control over African societies after 1880, and if so, what kind of control? How did colonial administration actually work, and to what ends did it work? Did the purpose or function of colonial rule change over time? How did the social structure of African societies change during the colonial era? How much of that change was directly attributable to colonialism itself?\\nHow comparable were the experiences of different African societies during the colonial era? Did the nationality of the colonizer make a significant difference? Did the nature of colonial authority vary for other reasons? Did African societies become more alike or similar in the first half of the 20th Century? Does the nature of colonial rule in Africa pose special historiographical or methodological problems for historical study? How did the content and character of cultural practice and everyday life change during the colonial era, and how much was colonialism responsible for that change? How did Africans think about or understand colonialism? How important was it to them? What social and political developments in African societies were primarily a response to or critique of colonial authority? What are the social and political origins of African nationalism? How did it relate to other social and political movements in Africa during the high imperial era from 1919-1945? Why did formal colonial rule in Africa come to an end after World War II? What primarily shaped the evolution of the postcolonial state and postcolonial African societies in the first two decades of independence? (1960-1980)? Did the relationship between African societies and the global system change significantly during that period?\\nWhy has much of postcolonial Africa suffered a series of recurrent political, economic and social catastrophes since 1980? Are all of those problems and failures in fact linked or connected? Are colonial and postcolonial useful or meaningful periodizations of African history?

In many African nations today, the only non-state actors with national presence and with an educated cadre are religious organizations. (In the last years of Mobutus rule in Zaire, for example, the Jesuits were running the civil service.) Some lower-level questions would be (I am sure you can think of many more):\\n- How has missionary religion impacted life before, during and after colonial rule? - How did western mission activities interact with traditional culture and religion?\\n- Were there differences between countries missioned mostly by Protestants versus those where Catholics dominated? I witnessed the ill-feeling and rivalry between Catholics and Protestants that still existed in Lesotho in the 1980s, almost a century after the first missionaries arrived. - Why did some regions see the rise of traditional-Christian hybrid churches, such as the African Zionist churches of southern Africa. Another topic of relevance is the relationship between colonial rule in Africa and rule by the same powers elsewhere, leading, for example, to the movement of Indians, Malays and Chinese people from British colonies in Asia to British colonies in East and Southern Africa. This topic is also relevant to the resistance to colonial rule, most famously in the case of Gandhi, who became political active in South Africa. Timothy Burke says: June 12, 2009 at 3:04 pm\\nI was thinking of fitting missionaries in under several of these questions. But if I were to drill down a bit, theres a set of slightly more specific questions that have a huge historiography built up around them. At the top of the list is, Why did Africans convert to Christianity in such numbers? and How should we think about missionaries in the wider context of colonial society? The comparative question is a huge, important one but I think it requires a separate seminar of its own to be serviced well. moldbug says: June 13, 2009 at 11:42 am\\nThe big picture is depressingly simple.\\nEuropean interaction with Africa falls into two paradigms: colonial (explorers, soldiers, merchants, settlers) and missionary. Before 1850, the pattern is almost exclusively colonial. Between 1850 and 1950, missionaries and colonialists contended. After 1950, the pattern is almost exclusively missionary.\\nPostcolonial Africa is simply the triumph of the missionary paradigm in its secular, American Unitarian-Quaker form. Your so-called development expert is a (Protestant) missionary in disguise. Hello, Mrs. Jellyby.\\nThe easiest way to see this is to read the colonialists, specifically their comments on the missionary paradigm. Many colonialists explained that, if you gave Africa over to the missionary, exactly what has happened would happen. See, for example, Burtons discussion of Sierra Leone in Wanderings in West Africa. If theres any 19th-century country that resembled what Africa has become in the caring hands of you humanitarian gentlemen, it is Sierra Leone. moldbug says: June 13, 2009 at 12:43 pm\\nAnd I hope you wont forget the tremendous human diversity of sub-Saharan Africa certainly our most diverse continent, at least from a biological perspective.\\nWicherts et al in Intelligence have just published a tremendous meta-analysis of studies on the cognitive dexterity of this diverse population. Worth a look. The previous figure, due to Lynn who is, lets face it, a racist is 70 or under. Heroic statistical efforts on the part of Wicherts et al, who are (so far as I can tell but surely the point could stand more investigation) not racists, bring it up to 82. It is certainly possible to write the history of Africa assuming that Africans are in fact Koreans. Little new can be done in this department, however. The scholars of the 20th century have already explored it to perfection. As for the actual history of Africa, so far as I can tell it is largely unknown.\\n(Anyone here read much Stuart Cloete? Stuart Cloete simply rocks.) moldbug says: June 13, 2009 at 12:51 pm\\nA good critical thread on the Wicherts paper is at Gene Expression.\\n(Note that Harvard has just created a new Department of Human Evolutionary Biology. In case youre not quite sure what human evolutionary biology is, its pretty much the same thing you used to call scientific racism. A good primer is the new Cochran-Harpending book, The 10,000-Year Explosion. Note that during the aforementioned 10,000 years, Homo sapiens was not exactly a single homogeneous gene pool.) moldbug says: June 13, 2009 at 1:01 pm\\nHere is a good exercise for you, Professor Burke: how would a colonialist answer these questions all of which are excellent and to the point?\\nSurely, as a historian of Africa, you study colonialism. In that case, you must want to know what colonialists were thinking. Since you are not a colonialist, you must have different answers to these questions. Perhaps you could ask a progressive development expert to answer them, then ask a colonialist to answer them, then compare the answers. Dont you think this would be a fun exercise? Unfortunately, all the colonialists are dead you seem to have killed them. Or defeated them, anyway. What a bother! Oh, well, we can always deconstruct them.\\nHowever, Ive been reading the colonialists, although hardly with any depth, and I can answer all these questions if you want. Im afraid most of my answers are quite short, however. And predictable. You may find it a more useful exercise to just imagine them. ca says: June 13, 2009 at 1:25 pm\\nThe questions are greatand the book may have already been written by someone else. Check out Adu Boahens classic collection of talks, _African Perspectives on Colonialism_ (1987).\\nTheres been plenty of research since then, but Boahens core of synthetic analysis stands up well, and remains an excellent point of departure for my students. The books also highly readable, which is a big advantage.\\nIt isnt perfecttheres an explicit whiggish pan-Africanism. Ive yet to find its equal as a primer, though. Timothy Burke says: June 13, 2009 at 2:47 pm\\nThe Boahen book is a very good example of these questions as a book, yeah. I think if I were going to tackle something like this, it would be a) from a perspective other than Boahens; b) with a mind to the historiography since 1987. ca says: June 14, 2009 at 12:44 pm\\nSounds good, but raises another question worth thinking about: Boahen came from a straightforward and explicit perspective, and its easy (and productive) for students to identify and critique. And he handled these subtle questions with the sorts of waves of detail and fact that impress students about how Africa really has a history. Real people lived there. They were creative, made choices, and acted as people, not just heros or victims. Much of the scholarship since 1987, though, consists of an awful lot of historians saying its more complicated even than that and other things that are well documented, but point toward the sort of ambiguity that in the classroom often leads students (especially less prepared ones) to conclude that historians know nothing, and that everythings just a matter of opinion. And this isnt exactly what most of us are about with these non-wikipediaable questions as issues of meaning and value rather than detail and evidence.\\nOne of the questions I struggle over every time I put together a syllabus is how to balance out the need for students to understand that history includes facts and realities that they need to learn, as well as ambiguity, changing interpretations, and historical argumentation.\\nObviously, students need both.\\nPerhaps the most constructive project would be to have students work out a research agenda: what would they need to know in order to come up with meaningful insights into your starting questions?\\nMore constructively, Id suggest you consider ending the semester with a couple weeks that suggested students test their interpretations of whether colonialism mattered by following along a couple of really big themes such as violence and gender. In other words, think about whether the insights developed help us understand change/continuity in the work done by gender, or the place of various sorts of violence in shaping power and experience.

Group Communication Introduction School Effectiveness A Collaborative Venture Work Groups Team Players Work Group Dynamics Group Talk Group Behavior Learning from Small Groups Communication Leadership Introduction With the call to restructure schools, educators have been challenged to respond to societal criticisms of K-12 school effectiveness. One way to actively deal with criticism is for every school to have good leadership. Leadership is critical to success of any restructuring goal. One of the qualities of an effective leader is the ability to help people communicate. This necessitates vision. Leaders who hold out vision to their constituents provide a unifying force for the organization that builds collaborative efforts. Educational leaders use collaboration to build work teams where educators can learn from each other. The goal for work teams in education is to benefit the students by improving communication, collaboration, and enhancement of individual participation in the school restructuring process. The members of these teams can be administrators, teachers, parents, community leaders, and students. The more people who are involved in improving schools, the greater the number of people who hold a stake in school excellence. Teamwork gets the things that need to be done, gets them done quicker, and gets them done with greater accountability. Employing work teams to participate in the decision-making process strengthens the people-to-people connections and improves schools. Work teams network the members of the school community. Back to Top School Effectiveness One of the greatest problems in education is the way school effectiveness is evaluated. Some educators in defense of education respond that the paradigm used to measure what takes place in schools is a mismatch of evaluation criteria to the educational model. Schools are often evaluated with an economic-industrial model that calls for profit/product margins to statistically reflect the correlation between the funds that education receives and its product, that is, the students. Educational critics use the industrial-based model to promote the concept that schools like businesses should relate input to output in purely numerical terms. However, this is far from the entire picture. While there are some parallels between business and education, schools have many human and social factors that are never considered in the industrial model. These factors contribute important parameters to the challenge of school restructuring. Back to Top A Collaborative Venture When teachers and administrators communicate, they view the school workplace as a collaborative venture. They are responsible and accountable for improving teaching and learning. Success is tied to the communication skills and abilities of all involved in the process. Leaders of change make choices as to who they will allow to contribute to the restructuring effort. When work teams are developed, they empower teachers and administrators alike to attain specified goals. Good communication enhances the efforts. By improving the communication between the members of the school community who want to improve performance, school administrators can target existing aspects of school life and analyze ways to make them better. Back to Top Work Groups Careful planning by educational leaders helps bring about change. In this plan of action the principal analyzes the players involved in the process and the process that brings them together. This reflection begins by looking at the way that interactive dialogue in schools has been transferred to small groups. Effective leaders focus on being highly goal-oriented and involving all the stake-holders. Once the leader creates the atmosphere for change, there must be ongoing communication to keep everyone moving toward the goals. Keeping things running smoothly takes focus. The leaders must stay on top of what is happening and take every opportunity to make things happen. Communication provides the means. With a work group as part of the plan of action the faculty and school community obtain a sense of direction in the form of a vision and a mission statement. Effective leaders understand how to make things happen. They empower others to offer their talents to accomplishing the task.\\nHow do communication principles support or undermine the interplay of exchange between the leader, the followers, and the ideas central to everyday school life? In a society that is becoming more and more independent in nature, America\\'s democratic tradition has made public debate a part of our negotiated world view. It is important that teachers and administrators understand the democratic principles that this perspective contributes to school communication. Public debate is considered a right. Small groups provide the arena for public discourse to allow decision-making activities to occur. Measured discussions avoid irrational and overly emotional statements. Back to Top Team Players Since schools have turned more and more often to the business community to solve some of their material and resource needs, many business practices have found their way into the education process. The idea of the \"team player\" evolved in the business culture and has migrated to education. The socialization process within the work groups is critical to the overall improvement of the system. In an individualistic society such as the United States, the crisis of authority and the hesitancy of educators to develop a team dimension to the work culture has had significant ramifications on the school culture. We want to be \"team players\". However, there are many questions that plague educators. For example, what knowledge is to be shared and with whom? Questions of this nature continue to plague teachers and administrators alike. What can educators do to strengthen the underlying principles that illuminate what educators do on teams? How can teachers and administrators communicate better? Back to Top Work Group Dynamics There are interpersonal dynamics that affect the productivity of the group. Early discussion of the dynamics of small groups began in the 30s. Researchers examined small groups and their communication dynamics and discovered that there are \"work moments\" and \"encounter moments.\" The work of scholars during the 70s, 80s, and 90s brought the need for improved communication skills to further the objectives of small groups. They noted that in addition to work moments there are specific individual dynamics operative in small groups. Mabry (1975) sketched out the macro-communicative patterns of \"encounter\" groups. By examining his work, we can better understand some of the social-emotional dimension that are at work in \"encounter\" moments. These take place between the work moments in small group activities. Today\\'s school workplace environment provides opportunities for teachers and administrators to work in small groups, on departmental teams, committees, and school-based management teams. For individuals who have traditionally worked in isolated classrooms in control of their environment and autonomous in their specific responsibilities, this is a break with tradition. Some conflictual personal characteristics are: an attraction-repulsion tendencies between the members, \"a hidden agenda,\" the needs of participants to sense, inclusion, control, and affection; group interactions that provide self-discovery, people who join groups to learn about what others think of them, self-disclosure and values discussions that are part of the agenda, and stages of interaction: boundary-seeking, ambivalence, and actualization (Cragen & Wright,1995). Nonetheless, despite the contest between individual needs and group needs, the opportunity for educators to work cooperatively presents a tool for educators to restructure schools from within. It is evident that in working with small groups there will always be some tension between individual and group goals. Therefore, it is valuable for school leaders -- teachers and administrators-- to understand and recognize the different types of groups. Thus, participants can maximize the opportunities that work groups provide. Back to Top Group Talk This is such a simple concept, one that we encounter everyday, a multitude of times each day. Yet, talk is an extremely varied textual and multifaceted means of communication. It has many forms. Some of these forms are heavily bound by parameters of time and place. In the classroom, one teaches or lectures. In the football stadium, one cheers. This is similarly the case in small group encounters. In small groups, one discusses. However, depending on the type of group and the purpose of the group the structure of the talk changes. Small groups in American education are the place where much of the work gets done. They are a valuable tool to improve education.\\nOne of the key mechanisms to understanding small group communication is the knowledge of what creates a small group. Cragen and Wright (1995) define a small group as \"a few people engaged in communication interaction over time, usually in face-to-face settings, who have common goals, norms, and have developed a communication pattern for meeting their goals in an independent manner (p.7).\" Some of the directly observable behaviors in small groups include: verbal and nonverbal communication especially use of the question form, people standing/sitting in proximity to one another, people communication with one another for some period of time, and a grouping of people of a characteristic but not specifically defined size (the optimum size is five to seven people). Other indirectly observable characteristics of small group communication have been noted by Kurt Lewin (1951) whose work has also been instrumental in the development of the action research paradigm. Here, he isolated key characteristics of small groups. These are: interdependence; shared values, beliefs, behaviors, and procedures regarding the group\\'s purpose; structural patterns that demonstrate four kinds of talk -- problem-solving, role talk, consciousness raising, and encounter talk; cohesive focus on goals; and perception of a boundary line that designated insiders from outsiders (Cragen and Wright (1995, p.12). During the interactive phase of a small group meeting, a symbolic transformation takes place during which the group gains its own identity. This consciousness raising is symbolic but indicative of convergence theory in speech theory when two conversants adjust their speech patterns to better accommodate the style of the other. The major types of small work groups are long-standing work groups, project groups, loosely formed \"prefab\" groups, quality circles, and computer decision-making groups. Every successful organization has a variation or combination of these work groups. Knowing the way each of these models functions and the way that they can contribute to the goals of improving schools is crucial to being an effective leader. Long-standing groups offer a long history of service to the productivity of the organization. These groups develop a sense of pride and tradition. New members feel compelled to assume traditional roles. Project work groups engender for themselves an identity that allows them to perform certain roles and tasks. This begins with the clarification of goals and an initial product that offers evidence of productivity. The group leader brings about quick self-disclosure and develops interpersonal trust and tolerance for differences. The \"Prefab\" group comes into being with strict definitions of roles and responsibilities for its members. It is a collection of people that have been rigidly structured to bring about a predictable level of productivity. A quality circle is credited to two Americans living in the 1950s in Japan, Edward Deming and Joseph Juran. Their purpose was to bring volunteers together to spend time outside their work environment to help solve departmental problems. Lastly, a computer decision-making group is part human and part machine. It allows the leaders to alter the dimensions of time and place by dissolving the problems of face-to-face communication between people with busy schedules. This group\\'s cyber dimension changes many of the parameter of traditional working group and the culture of the organizational group that uses it.\\nEveryday in work groups across the U.S. there are \"working moments\" and \"encounter moments\" where the members of the group break from the task at-hand and center on the beliefs or personal feelings of those involved. Researchers have identified these as a hidden agenda. The management of this phenomenon is critical to successful handling of the task before the group and involvement of the group members. When properly supervised the work group\\'s communication produces what Bennis and Shepard (1956) call \"valid communication\" which leads to both task accomplishment and personal growth. Back to Top Group Behavior Group behavior has an identifiable form and specific communication behaviors that are associate with group sessions. In the following discussion, we will examine some of these behaviors and their implications for the success of our communication goals. Understanding their forms and their power has potential for establishing new school communication processes. Learning from Small Groups It is not sufficient to say that all group communication can lead to better understanding and goal realization. There must be focused effort on the part of the leadership to help work teams develop their potential. This takes place when members come to understand the relationship between communication theories, processes, skills, and understanding. Organizational culture partly determines what is appropriate and effective in small group communication. As the school principal has the main role in developing school culture, the school work environment provides a natural conduit to realize potential.\\nThe goals of effective work group communication are productivity, quality, consensus, and member satisfaction (Cragen & Wright,1995). Four types of talk lead to accomplish these in small work teams. They are role talk, task talk, social talk, and consciousness raising (CR). When all of these function effectively, the group is motivated and things go well. CR talk contributes to motivation. Role talk evolves into members taking on various roles. Problem-solving talk brings about understanding and consensus.\\nDewey\\'s process of reflective thinking (1910) influenced the way educators handled the teaching of discussion skills. McBurney and Hance (1939) used Dewey\\'s ideas to construct a platform which describes the way to analyze a problem. They offer the following: definition and delineation of the problem, analysis of the problem, suggestion of solutions, reasoned development of the proposed solution, and additional verification (Cragen & Wright, 1995; p. 29). Bales (1950) contributed a significant observation to the study of group dynamics. This is the descriptive model of a work team based on a system of Interactive Process Analysis (IPA). IPA is an instrument for coding communication acts in a group into two categories --social-emotional and task. These forces need to be managed and maintained in equilibrium. This can be achieved by working through three stages of problem solving. First, members orient themselves that is, they determine a common definition of the problem. Second, the group clarifies a common standard for assessing the problem. Third, the members decide who and what shall control their efforts. This is an internal struggle that takes place as the group clarifies the status of its members as they seek a solution. The communication process works through a number of tensions as the group seeks to define its identity. By observing the communication patterns of the group, Fisher (1970) concludes that four dynamic stages take place -- orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. Each phase offers members a means of building intra-group dynamics. The orientation stage begins the process. Members are tentative, make small talk, and seek to clarify where they want to go. During the conflict stage, the group participants express their opinions, align themselves, and polarize. At the emergence phase, polarization decreases and new alliances are formed. Finally, in the reinforcement phase, consensus is reached. This takes the form of verbal agreement and product outcome. Back to Top Communication Leadership In developing administrative teams and mentoring teacher-leaders, the principal moves the school toward the group\\'s goal. Effective communication is a means toward this end. The work team provides an opportunity for this to happen. In small work group communication, there are specific role and skills that have been identified as essential. The ten most frequently played roles in communication groups are -- the task leader, social-emotional leaders, tension releaser, information provider, central negative, questioner, silent observer, active listener, recorder, and self-centered follower. As teams are formed and get together to solve problems, trust and empathy are needed to build a receptive environment. The interpersonal relationship that the people develop helps bring divergent ideas closer together. Crucial to the mix is an understanding of how verbal and non-verbal codes function in groups.\\nMuch has been written on the difference between the word and the thought. There is a specific \"language\" -- verbal and non-verbal -- that conveys meaning to group members. Examples of these are the use of acronyms. Technical words associate aspects of with the task at-hand. Symbolic referentials such as use of historical figures to represent character traits of the group (e.g., the Abe Lincole group), often indicate a silent code of behaviors that are appreciated and others that are not.\\nNon-verbal language also communicates important ideas. These are divided into two groups. The first, the environment or setting drives the proximity of spatial relationship. Objectives such as the seat placement or the choice of meeting rooms indicate non-verbal nuances. Chronemics or methods of marking time; impact the length of meetings and the priority of the topic. Second, personal behaviors tell the careful observer about the way participants receive the ideas of others. Eye movement, vocalics -- grunts and groans, and kinesics -- body movements and gestures offer sometimes nonchalant and other times glaring indications of how people feel. A good group leader can use this information to help move the discussion along in the right direction.\\nWe have discussed a host of characteristics that researchers have uncovered about effective communication in small groups. School leaders who offer vision can use this knowledge to motivate administrators, teachers, community members, and students to attain common goals through work group interactions. While we always begin with humble ideas, it is incumbent on those who want to lead effectively to remove the obstacles from his or her school reaching these goals.\\nEffective communication is a tool for enlisting stakeholders\\' cooperation. There are risks -- self-disclosure, the danger of stereotypic judgments, individual differences, and emotional insecurities along the way. However, work groups build school teams by making time in busy schedules to get to know others and learn from each other.\\nThis reflection has offered a number of ideas about the form of work teams. It assumes that school members want a means of effectively communicating. In the school workplace where individualism has long been the norm, old habits are hard to break. Nonetheless, in the restructured school environment where all are stakeholders are effective communicators, goals are shared and achieved.

With a private pilot certificate you will have the freedom to fly wherever you want! You will be able to impress your friends and family as you take them soaring through the sky. Our specially designed syllabus will guide you through the learning process and enable you to master the art of flying as efficiently as possible. We have carefully coordinated reading assignments with each flight lesson so that you will be properly prepared for each lesson. This will help you maximize your ability to learn, reducing your overall cost and helping you to succeed. We have developed a structured flight training\\nprogram operating under FAA Part 61 for teaching our primary students how to fly. Our goal is to help you learn how to fly as quickly and cheaply as possible, while ensuring that you\\'ll be a safe pilot. Our specially designed syllabus will guide you through the learning process and enable you to master the art of flying as efficiently as possible. We have carefully coordinated reading assignments with each flight lesson so that you will be properly prepared for each lesson and help you to maximize your ability to learn during for each lesson - reducing your overall cost and helping you to succeed. Your American Airman Private Pilot Flight Training Syllabus provides you with important guidance and information about your flight training program. It is designed to meet, or exceed, the legal requirements of 14 CFR Part 61; and it is designed to allow students to acquire the proficiency and experience needed to meet the certification requirements for attaining a U.S. FAA Private Pilot Certificate. Before you Get Started FAA Requirements: You must be at least 16 years old to solo and 17 years old to become a Private Pilot. You must have at least a 3rd Class Medical prior to your first solo. This is very easy to obtain and should be done early in your flight training - before you make a substantial investment. Please ask us for help in finding a convenient location to obtain your medical. You must have a strong command of the English language Other Suggestions: You should buy at least a basic book package so that you can begin studying. You should have sufficient time to allow for two flight lessons per week. Pricing Information The cost of flight training will vary greatly from person to person depending upon availability for training, study habits, motor skills, and weather conditions. Because of these variables, the following estimates are not guaranteed. We believe they are reasonable estimates for a person possessing average intelligence & motor skills, who is beginning flight training in the Northeast with ZERO previous experience. It is also important to keep in mind that these estimates are NOT based on FAA minimums, and the actual cost to you may be less. We feel it is better to provide a more realistic price than a \"best case scenario\" which could lead to frustration later. We encourage you to ask us any and all questions you may have. Private Pilot Course The current national average to earn a Private Pilot Certificate is 55-65 hours of flight time. The average in the Northeast (due primarily to weather), is closer to 70 hours. The FAA minimum requires 40 hours of flight time. The average person will probably require 35-40 lessons, and it usually costs $180-$220 per lesson (depending on length and subject of lesson). Assuming 40 lessons at $200 per lesson, a reasonable estimate to earn a private pilot certificate is $8,000. Other costs such as books, equipment, and exam fees will cost an additional $500-$800 (See Pilot Supplies ). In an effort to help minimize these costs, our carefully designed training syllabus uses only FAA publications, which are not only the definitive word on the subject, they are also the least expensive.

We will study biochemistry, the cell, physiology, metabolism, growth and reproduction, genetics, taxonomy, evolution, and ecology. Instructor: My name is Dr. Stephen Wagner. I have a B.S. in Environmental Biology from Heidelberg College, an MS in Microbiology from North Carolina State University, and a Ph.D. in Agronomy (Soil Microbiology) from Clemson University. I spent two years as a postdoctoral research associate with the USDA, working on herbicide biodegradation. This is my 17th year at SFA. My major research interest is microbial ecology, emphasizing bioremediation, plant-microbe interactions, and effects of management practices on soil ecology. Besides this course my courses include Prenursing Microbiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Microbial Ecology, Industrial Microbiology, Planetary and Space Biology, and SFA 101. -8 pre-service teachers and direct projects funded by NASA and the Department of Education to develop this program and a similar program for in-service teachers. Outside of work I enjoy gardening, walking our dog Charlie Brown, hiking, home improvement, cheering on my school and Cleveland, Ohio teams, attending church, and doing volunteer work. We have two children who are both married: Michael (age 26) and our daughter-in-law Katie (age 26) and Melissa (age 24) and our son-in-law Matt (Age 24). Melissa is expecting her first baby boy in November! SI Leader: I am very excited that Kyle Sherling, a former student of this course, will be helping us as our SI Leader. Kyle can be reached at: Phone: (972) 838-7697 Email: sherlingkw@titan.sfasu.edu Lecture Text: Essential Biology with Physiology, 4th Edition, by Simon, Reece, and Dickey, 2012, Pearson/Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco with Mastering Biology access card. Turning Point Response Card: All students are required to use a response device (clicker) for every meeting held for this course. These are readily available for purchase from several bookstores on and off of campus. Because we will use the clicker for attendance and lab quizzes, you must bring this to every class period. Typically these will be used during the first few minutes of class. Therefore if you do not have your clicker or are late to class, you will be counted absent and/or fail the lab quiz. Please purchase this and bring it to class by the 3rd class day (next Tuesday). Attendance Policy: You are expected to attend all lectures and exams. Because this course is a science activities course that usually will involve group activities, your attendance and participation in the class is very important. Absences are only excused as outlined in the university handbook: attendance is expected at all classes, laboratories, and other activities for which a student is registered. For those classes where attendance is a factor in the course grade, the instructor shall make his/her class policy known in writing at the beginning of each term and shall maintain an accurate record of attendance. Regardless of attendance, every student is responsible for course content and assignments. It is University policy to excuse students from attendance for certain reasons. Among these are absences related to health, family emergencies, and student participation in certain University-sponsored events. Students are responsible for providing documentation satisfactory to the instructor for each class missed. Students with acceptable excuses will be permitted to make up work for absences to a maximum of three weeks of a semester or one week of a six-week summer term when the nature of the work In the case of absences caused by participation in University-sponsored events, announcement of such absences by the Vice President for Academic Affairs will constitute an official excuse. Faculty members should submit a written explanation of the absence, including the date, time and an alphabetical listing of all students attending to the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs for publication. You must make prior arrangements if you have to miss an exam or presentation. Please contact me before the exam if there is any problem. I will use a different format for makeup exams than the format used for the exams given to the rest of the class. All makeup exams will be given during the last week of the semester (December 3 - 7) to students who provide documented proof for a legitimate excused absence as described by university policy. Students who are late for an exam will not be permitted to take the exam and will only be allowed to take a makeup exam if there is a legitimate excuse (as described by university policy) for being late. Office Hours: Your success in this course as well as here at SFA is very important. Should you have questions or need additional help I maintain an open door policy and encourage every student to talk freely about any issue that concerns them. My office hours for the summer are listed above. If I am not in my office, I will leave a note as to my whereabouts. Also check rooms 101 (BIO Dept. office), or 207 and 208 (labs). Academic Integrity (A-9.1): Academic integrity is a responsibility of all university faculty and students. Faculty members promote academic integrity in multiple ways including instruction on the components of academic honesty, as well as abiding by university policy on penalties for cheating and plagiarism. I expect everyone to do her own, original work. This includes all exams, quizzes, and assignments. We will take appropriate disciplinary action, as described in the University Student Handbook, against anyone that does not comply with this policy. Definition of Academic Dishonesty As stated in the university handbook: \"Academic dishonesty includes both cheating and plagiarism. Cheating includes but is not limited to (1) using or attempting to use unauthorized materials to aid in achieving a better grade on a component of a class; (2) the falsification or invention of any information, including citations, on an assigned exercise; and/or (3) helping or attempting to help another in an act of cheating or plagiarism. Plagiarism is presenting the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own. Examples of plagiarism are (1) submitting an assignment as if it were one\\'s own work when, in fact, it is at least partly the work of another; (2) submitting a work that has been purchased or otherwise obtained from an Internet source or another source; and (3) incorporating the words or ideas of an author into one\\'s paper without giving the author due credit.\" Acceptable Student Behavior: conduct the class or the ability of other students to learn from the instructional program (see the - Students with Special Needs: Students who require special accommodations for this course will be provided such accommodations within established university guidelines. Students who are requesting support services from SFA are required to submit documentation through the Office of Disability Services to verify eligibility for reasonable accommodations; the institution must review and evaluate that documentation. To obtain disability related accommodations and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), Human Services Building, Room 325, 468-3004/ 468-1004 (TDD) as early as possible in the semester. Once verified, ODS will notify the course instructor and outline the accommodation and/or auxiliary aids to be provided. Please note that the only way you can get extra time to finish exams and/or work for the course is to be verified by ODS that you are eligible to receive this accommodation. Use of Electronic Devises: Use of computers and/or other wireless devises is not permitted in class. You may, however, audio and/or video record the lectures. Listening to a biology lecture repeatedly may not be Use of calculators will not be permitted for any exams. Ringing, playing, or singing cell phones or someone responding to one are a huge interruption during lectures; if you own or use one, please turn it off for lectures or do not bring it into the lecture hall. Additionally it is now university policy that repeated disruptions is grounds for dismissal from a course taught at SFASU. Extra Credit, Bonus Points: Opportunities for extra credit or bonus points will not be given to individual students but rather to all students as a whole. Students with excessive unexcused absences and/or tardiness will not receive any additional points. Course Evaluation: All students are required to complete a course evaluation at the end of the semester for both the lecture and lab sections. Failure to complete this evaluation will result in a 1% deduction in your final grade for the course. Course Requirements and Grading: The grade in the lecture portion of this class is based on the following criteria. Please remember that lecture and laboratory grades are computed into one grade; the same grade is recorded for both lecture and lab. The lab portion counts 1/4 (25%) while the lecture portion counts 2/3 (67%) of your final grade. There will be 1000 points possible for the entire course as summarized below) 1. Lecture Exams (600/1000 pts): I have scheduled 4 lecture exams during the semester. The syllabus lists the scheduled dates of these exams. Each exam is worth 150 points of the total points for the course. 2. Attendance (50/1000 pts): In order to encourage participation in the course you will receive some credit for attending class. Attendance will be compiled at the end of the semester. The total is worth 50 points of the total points for the course. 3. Mastering Biology Assignments (100/1000 pts): developed by the publisher of your book provides you access to a multitude of material to help you master the course! You will be required to complete several assignments using this resource. Please follow the instructions in your student access kit to enroll in my course. The course ID is: BIO121WAGNERF2013 4. Final Exam: This exam will be an online (Mastering Biology website) exam. Points earned on it will be applied as bonus points toward your total course points. 5. Lab Grade (250/1000 pts.): As noted above, you will receive a separate lab grade that will be used to calculate one final grade for the course. Therefore this is worth 250 points of the total points for the course. Summary of Course Grade 1. 4 Lecture Exams @ 150 pts. = 600 points 2. Attendance Quizzes @ 50 pts. = 50 points 3. Mastering Biology Assignments @ 100 pts. = 100 points 4. Lab Grade @ 250 points = 250 points 5. Total 1000 points Grading Scale 895-1000 pts. Or 90 - 100% = A 795-894 pts. Or 80 - 89% = B 695-794 pts. Or 70 - 79% = C 595-694 pts. Or 60 - 69% = D < 594 pts Or Below 60% = F Be On Time! You are disrupting the class if you come in late, leave early or walk out of the class during lecture time. Keep in mind that all your classmates paid the same amount of money that you did to take the course and deserve the best course we can possibly give them! Also, if you need an extra hour of sleep be considerate of these situations. Please let me know if you have to come in late or leave the lecture early. If you make a habit of disrupting the class I will subtract points from your final attendance grade. No Food or Beverages in Lecture Hall! The housekeepers who take care of the lecture halls work very hard to maintain a clean lecture hall and do not make a lot of money doing this. Please help them by not consuming food and beverages other than water while you attend class. e Ship! BIO 121 FALL 2013 COURSE SYLLABUS SUBJECT DAYS CHAPTER I. The Chemical Role to Life A.

The course\\rwill also introduce the student to basic techniques for the\\rassessment of relative military capabilities between adversaries in\\rgiven theaters of military action. Central to the course will be an\\rexamination of historical cases of military action that shed light on\\rcurrent defense issues. Students will be evaluated on the basis of one paper and a final\\rexam. The paper will consist of an analysis of a current conventional\\rforces problem. The paper will be due one week before the last day of\\rclass. This means that you should begin working on the paper at the\\rbeginning of the semester. Some eligible topics are listed at the end\\rof this syllabus. There will be an undergraduate discussion section.\\rAttendance for the discussion section and lectures is mandatory. Required reading consists of a xeroxed collection of class notes\\rwhich can be purchased at Graphic Arts in the basement of E51 (Sloan\\rBldg.), delineated as \"CN\" in the syllabus.

Not all of these topics\\rnarrowly concern US military forces, but they all bear on future US\\rmilitary planning. WARNING: These are complex tasks of research and analysis. If you\\rdo not know much about Dewey and Hayden Libraries, now is the time to\\rlearn. You should discuss your paper topic with\\ryour\\rTA in the early part of the term. A topic\\rshould be selected by February\\r26, and a preliminary outline and research\\rplan should be turned in. A more comprehensive outline will be due\\rApril 2. The final paper is\\rdue May 7. Assess the air and ground campaigns that would attend a clash of arms on the Korean Peninsula. What might be the military objectives of each side? Could they achieve them? How might the fighting be terminated? US Navy open source threat assessment documents now discuss the danger to US interests posed by the \"proliferation\" of submarines around the world. Assess this threat. You will find it necessary to use a combination of political and military analysis. What is the USN\\'s apparent proposed remedy for this \"threat?\" Does the remedy seem sensible to you? Why or Why not? Discuss the vulnerability of ports to attack. How easy would it be for an adversary to seriously impair reinforcement by attacks on ports? S. Korean ports vs. N. Korean, or Saudi ports vs. a future Iraqi or Iranian attack can be your base case. (Suggest other cases if you wish.) Many current proposals to cut the defense budget without cutting force structure advocate increased use of reserve troops. Assess the military wisdom, the political wisdom, and the practical possibilities of such proposals in the US. You would be advised to examine the historical record in the US and other countries regarding such forces. It will be necessary to consider the utility of reservists with reference to particular military contingencies. Since 1980 the US military has undertaken a number of missions. Discuss these missions in comparative perspective. What do these experiences tell us about the strengths and the weaknesses of the US military? Be sure to assess the missions from both a \"tactical-operational\" and a \"politico-military\" perspective. This paper should not discuss Operation Desert Shield. What is the security value of the West Bank to the state of Israel? Presuming there is some value, what political-military arrangements would permit a withdrawal? What might be the US role in such arrangements? (Alternatively, you may answer this question with reference to the Golan Heights.) South Korean defense officials have recently voiced concern over the growth in Japanese military capabilities. How much and what types of additional forces would Japan need before it represented a serious potential invasion or blockade threat to South Korea? How long would these capabilities take to acquire, and how could South Korea respond? Are South Korean concerns well founded? Evaluate the military balance in South Asia (India and Pakistan). What conventional military pressures, if any, are fueling the nuclear arms race on the subcontinent? Could conventional arms control ease these pressures? Suppose that the UN decided to put enough force into the disputed areas of what was once Yugoslavia to make it safe for all refugees to return to their homes--ie enough force to police the formerly ethnically mixed areas of the region. How much force would that be?? In 1993 there was both a war and a genocide in Rwanda. At the time, some advocated military intervention. That intervention did not occur. Similarly, a military intervention nearly occurred in neighboring Zaire, just a few months ago. Analyze either of these possible interventions. Currently the United States aims to \"enlarge\" the NATO alliance. The first candidates for membership are Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Both the CBO and the Rand corporation have tried to assess the costs of this policy, should it occur. Your job is to take the next step. Other candidates for future membership in NATO are the Baltic states, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, Slovakia, Rumania, and possibly even Ukraine or Belarus. Assess the costs of integrating some of these states into the Alliance. During last years crisis in the Taiwan Strait it became apparent that the conventional wisdom among American defense experts is that China does not have sufficient military capability to conquer Taiwan. Is the conventional wisdom well founded? If so, is Taiwans present security vis-a-vis China likely to erode in the foreseeable future? Alternatively, what are the current and future threats to Taiwan from a Chinese military blockade? When the Coalition launched the ground offensive during Desert Storm the Iraqis in and around Kuwait City fled north toward Iraq. Suppose that the Iraqi forces had decided to stay in Kuwait City and fight. What number of US ground forces would have been required to conquer the city? How long might it have taken? Estimate the number of US casualties. to GPF page ']\n",

      "['Political Theories of Democracy (Political Science 571)For most of its history, democracy has been regarded as among the most undesirable forms ofgovernment. For Aristotle, who defined it as rule with a view to the advantage of those who are\\npoor, democracy was a deviation from the superior form of government he termed polity, a\\nmixed regime that included oligarchic elements. For Plato, democracy was characterized by\\ntotal license; it naturally degenerated into tyranny. And even for the American Founding\\nFather James Madison, democracyunderstood as direct popular rulewas a dangerous form of\\ngovernment posing serious threats to both individual rights and collective well-being. By thestart of the twenty-first century, however, it seems that the conventional wisdom aboutdemocracy has taken a 180 degree turn. Few contemporary political thinkers fail to endorse\\ndemocracy as the bestor at least the best possibleform of rule. And few political practitioners\\nclaim to be anything other than small d democrats. What accounts for this shift in the place\\naccorded democracy in contemporary political thought? What exactly is it that political\\nphilosophersand leaders and activistsendorse when they endorse the democratic ideal? And\\nhow does this apparent consensus on the value of democracy thrive amidst profound\\ndisagreement about political ends?This course provides an overview of debates about the contested meaning and significance ofthis key political concept, democracy, with a focus in particular on debates among political\\ntheorists and philosophers. Over the course of the quarter, we will compare ancient and modern\\nconceptions of democracy and democratic citizenship. We will ask what role, if any, rights\\nshould play in our understanding of democratic self-governance. We will ask what democratic\\npolitical participation does, and should, entail. And we will consider recent arguments in favor\\nof, and against, a specifically deliberative understanding of democracy. More generally, moving\\nbeyond the apparent consensus on democracy, we will explore and engage in debates about what\\nit means to govern democratically, whether democracy is in fact realized in polities that claim its\\nname, and how best to further the democratic project.Course readings and requirements vary quarter to quarter.

Red Beetle06-07-2005, 07:51 AMWhen considering how to improve any Martial System it is necessary to take inventory, and examine if what is being taught is logically consistent and beneficial to the system as a whole. Take for example the teaching of \"Ki.\" Lots of Aikido people run around talking about \"ki\", but the fact of the matter is that the teaching of \"ki\" is simply a mystical/magical teaching which conjures belief in superstitious nonsense. :p Students attempt to clear their minds, chant words or syllables, breath a certain way, assume postures, and so forth in the attempt to grasp or develop a magical power that is about as real as George Lucas\\' \"Force.\" :cool: Students and Teachers would do better spending their time in the examination of, and actual practice of technical skills, rather than pretending to direct a make believe power from their bowels to their fingers. Another example of the useless mysticism inherent in Aikido was the recent video that appeared on one of the forum threads. The clip did a nice job demonstrating technical skills that actually make up the system of Aikido. However, from time to time one would see something like: \"Aikido is love.\" flash on to the screen. :crazy: Aikido is love? Please. Why not say, \"Baseball is love.\" , \"Golf is love.\", \"Nascar is love\", or whatever else someone decides love is to them. The word \\'love\\' quickly loses any meaning. If a word can mean anything, then it simply means nothing. Aikido is not love. :yuck: Aikido is a Martial system. Aikido class may be a place in which you can practice loving your neighbor, but Aikido is not love. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido was a nice guy, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught was the source of this kindness. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido claims that what he teaches will bring a moral harmony and love for mankind, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught actually accomplishes his claims. If a person was not familiar with Aikido, and its mystical teachings, do you really think that such a person would conclude that Aikido was the way of peaceful harmony just by watching a demonstration of Aikido projections or neutralizations? Of course not. They may be impressed, but no such moral assertion will be made from watching such a demonstration. The reason it would be impossible to deduce a moral principal from a visual or tangible demonstration is because you cannot start with something you see (Aikido demo), and end up with something you cannot see (moral ideas). One can practice ethics in Aikido class, but one cannot deduce ethics from Aikido. If ethics are taught at Aikido class, then they did not come from Iriminage or kotegaeshi, but from Asian philosophy or religion. Since that is clearly the case, why should I pay homage to such Asian religious philosophy? Why not some other religion? Why not deontology? Why not utilitarianism? If I want to go to church, why would I go to Aikido class? If I want to learn how not to fight, couldn\\'t I just ask an Amish person? Wouldn\\'t that be easier than all that physical combat training? Aikido is combat training isn\\'t it? The Amish manage not to fight without Aikido. The Amish manage to live in harmony without Aikido. Maybe Morihei Uyeshiba should have joined an Amish community instead of the religious school of Omoto-kyo. If you don\\'t need Aikido to live in harmony and peace with your neighbor, and clearly you don\\'t, then maybe Aikido doesn\\'t need Asian philosophy of religion in order to function. Maybe Aikido is simply a physical exercise that can be used in a self-defense situation. RED BEETLE www.kingsportjudo.com\\nMashu06-07-2005, 08:32 AMYou aren\\'t talking about the mysticism itself but the mistaken/misinterpreted or incomplete views of Aikido that many of it\\'s practitioners have. So your rant is like laughing at one of the blind men groping an elephant. They each think the part they have their hand on(or perhaps in) is the elephant but no matter how vehemently they argue their point they are wrong. Some of them aren\\'t even touching the elephant ffs.\\nmj06-07-2005, 10:49 AMI\\'m afraid I have to agree. You obviously have not trained indepth with Aikido so you are coming across as arrogant and insulting, which I am sure you do not intend to be Red. The first lesson of Aikido, imo, is connection. There is no point discussing until you have this to give us a place to start communicating with each other. btw I don\\'t consider myself to be a nice guy...just nicer than before :)\\nMichael Neal06-07-2005, 11:14 AMNo I think red made some very valid points.\\nKevin Leavitt06-07-2005, 11:41 AMI actually disagree with alot of what he said. I certainly understand from his perspective that this may not be what aikido is to him, but it certainly is to many and I don\\'t consider it to be a waste of time spending time on the \"internal\" aspects. Why do you want to focus soley on the technical aspects of the art? What is it that you want to gain. \"Combat effectiveness\"? Your living in a world of romantic bullshido if you think that any martial art is going to give you skills that will make you combat effective in and of itself. Sure, you can get some good things like kotegaeshi, nikkyo etc...but failure to understand the underpinnings of principle will leave you lacking. Building character, perception, and the ability to read a situation and people around you is much more important aspect of studying martial arts than any limited technical skills you may learn. The art of awareness, posture, breathing, the ability to keep calm under pressure are much more important to my overall combat effectiveness. I\\'ve used all those things in \"combat\" , rarely have I ever used any of my technical skills. sure, there are those that I do not consider warriors or \"martial artist\" that study aikido, but that does not mean that aikido is not meant for them. They get something out of it. I get much of the same that they do. Aikido can be an allegory for peace and can be a physical manifestation of resolving conflict. I think that is a wonderful thing. What is wrong with that? I don\\'t consider it a waste of time. If you want simply the \"external\" things that make you \"combat effective\". Get yourself a stick, some pepper spray, a gun, and take some classes and learn how to use them the right way. I guarantee you will be miles ahead of anyone who studies TMA or any empty hand art at all. Please spare me all the \"what if\" scenarios dealing with why you need to study empty hand while you are alone in a sterile environment. I consider that to be a waste of time for 99.9% of the time.\\nDon_Modesto06-07-2005, 11:41 AM....Lots of Aikido people run around talking about \"ki\", but the fact of the matter is that the teaching of \"ki\" is simply a mystical/magical teaching which conjures belief in superstitious nonsense. Either that or a problem of translation (and thus, lazy student: study more.) Students attempt to clear their minds, chant words or syllables, breath a certain way, assume postures, and so forth in the attempt to grasp or develop a magical power that is about as real as George Lucas\\' \"Force.\" People who took UKEMI from Osensei have a different opinion, of course. Students and Teachers would do better spending their time in the examination of, and actual practice of technical skills, rather than pretending to direct a make believe power from their bowels to their fingers. Assuming there\\'s a contradiction here... Shaun Ravens has some interesting things to say about the \"mysticism\" of these practices... Another example of the useless mysticism inherent in Aikido was the recent video that appeared on one of the forum threads. The clip did a nice job demonstrating technical skills that actually make up the system of Aikido. However, from time to time one would see something like: \"Aikido is love.\" flash on to the screen. :crazy: Aikido is love? Please. Why not say, \"Baseball is love.\" , \"Golf is love.\", \"Nascar is love\", or whatever else someone decides love is to them. From the founder himself. But in Japanese it\\'s a pun. \"AI\", written with different Ch. characters means both \"harmony\" and \"love\". The word \\'love\\' quickly loses any meaning. If a word can mean anything, then it simply means nothing. Yes. A complaint of my own, actually. But read into mysticism a little bit and you find that this is a feature, not a bug. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido was a nice guy, Not sure he was. this is no basis for concluding that what he taught was the source of this kindness.Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido claims that what he teaches will bring a moral harmony and love for mankind, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught actually accomplishes his claims. Valid point. See essays of Ellis Amdur for a nicely fleshed out argument on this. If a person was not familiar with Aikido, and its mystical teachings, do you really think that such a person would conclude that Aikido was the way of peaceful harmony just by watching a demonstration of Aikido projections or neutralizations? Yup. People see what they want to see and often what they\\'re told to see. The reason it would be impossible to deduce a moral principal from a visual or tangible demonstration is because you cannot start with something you see (Aikido demo), and end up with something you cannot see (moral ideas). Crick saw snakes and imagined DNA; Einstein saw himself on a light beam and saw Relativity. If I want to go to church, why would I go to Aikido class? UPAYA/HOBEN/Skilful Means If I want to learn how not to fight, couldn\\'t I just ask an Amish person? Wouldn\\'t that be easier than all that physical combat training? Read Saotome--Aikido and the Harmony of Nature. Aikido is combat training isn\\'t it? Precisely, no. If you don\\'t need Aikido to live in harmony and peace with your neighbor, and clearly you don\\'t, then maybe Aikido doesn\\'t need Asian philosophy of religion in order to function. Maybe Aikido is simply a physical exercise that can be used in a self-defense situation. Sounds like jujutsu. Aikido has a specific history and purpose. You don\\'t know it, so aikido plays nail to your only tool, the hammer. Fun post, though. Reminds me of myself. Thanks.\\nMashu06-07-2005, 11:56 AMWhen considering how to improve any Martial System it is necessary to take inventory, and examine if what is being taught is logically consistent and beneficial to the system as a whole. O\\'Sensei would agree: \"The Art of Peace begins with you. Work on yourself and your appointed task in the Art of Peace. Everyone has a spirit that can be refined, a body that can be trained in some manner, a suitable path to follow. You are here for no other purpose than to realize your inner divinity and manifest your innate enlightenment. Foster peace in your own life and then apply the Art to all that you encounter\" Another example of the useless mysticism inherent in Aikido was the recent video that appeared on one of the forum threads. The clip did a nice job demonstrating technical skills that actually make up the system of Aikido. However, from time to time one would see something like: \"Aikido is love.\" flash on to the screen. or ? Maybe they were mistaken. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido was a nice guy, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught was the source of this kindness. I believe O\\'Sensei was not particularly wrapped up in the western concept of good and evil but I could be wrong. I think he was more interested in what was appropriate. If a person was not familiar with Aikido, and its mystical teachings, do you really think that such a person would conclude that Aikido was the way of peaceful harmony just by watching a demonstration of Aikido projections or neutralizations? Of course not. They may be impressed, but no such moral assertion will be made from watching such a demonstration. You can\\'t know it until you are in it. Even then it is difficult. An outsider drawing conclusions about what it is and what it isn\\'t is probably doing himself a disservice. The reason it would be impossible to deduce a moral principal from a visual or tangible demonstration is because you cannot start with something you see (Aikido demo), and end up with something you cannot see (moral ideas). Aikido techniques are supposed to be very solution oriented with just the right thing with nothing more and nothing less. From this you could find that this principle is useful in other areas. If I want to learn how not to fight, couldn\\'t I just ask an Amish person? Wouldn\\'t that be easier than all that physical combat training? Aikido is combat training isn\\'t it? The Amish manage not to fight without Aikido. The Amish manage to live in harmony without Aikido. Maybe Morihei Uyeshiba should have joined an Amish community instead of the religious school of Omoto-kyo. Amish people don\\'t fight back as far as I know. This would leave them very vulnerable. They may appear non-violent but the self-violence they potentially open themselves to seems to make them rather violent in a way. This is against Aiki principles and therefore being Amish has nothing to do with Aikido. Anyway, I hope I haven\\'t stuck my head in the elephant too deeply.\\nChrisHein06-07-2005, 12:10 PMThe Problem with mysticism, is that it\\'s mysterious. If you lose the mystery (not knowing what\\'s going on) then it\\'s no longer mysterious, however if you don\\'t lose the mystery, then you can never learn what you are doing. Mystery is for the ignorant. If you know what \"ki\" is (or rather what others refer to as being \"ki\"), it\\'s not mystical anymore. Most people in Aikido are trying to become masters of something that they want to stay in the dark about. It\\'s very hard to pin Aikidoka (I\\'m generalizing here) down when it comes to asking them what they want. I think the main reason for this is because they want to keep everything a mystery. They don\\'t want to come to the conclusion that Aikido\\'s syllabus isn\\'t good for everything. They don\\'t want to conclude that Aiki is basically rhythm, and reading of intention. They don\\'t want to discover that \"ki\" is just alignment and energy exchange that any high school physicist could explain to you. If they came to a conclusion on any of these things they would loose their mystical system. Unfortunately by doing this they limit themselves to mediocrity. By never admitting to yourself that a something is normal, dependable, and useful, you can never master it. This isnt a sickness limited only to Aikidoka, its an infection you see in the whole traditional martial arts community. They would rather not understand the reason for something, so they can live in the hope that it will never be just normal. People want fantasy, and mystery. Thetas all fine and well Intel you attempt to learn, master, and teach something. Ive often said that most traditional martial artists should join a reenactment group, or theater company and not a dojo. The only problem with this non-mystical thinking is that it tends to close down openness to new things. Which is what Im always looking for. If there is some new way to do something (even if I have to dance around in a funny dress, and yell vowels to find it) I want to learn it, this however doesn\\'t mean I should turn a blind eye to what I already know, and be afraid to admit what I have learned. -Chris Hein\\nMary Eastland06-07-2005, 02:33 PMI don\\'t think there is anything mystical about training to become stronger and then less likely to become a victim. Ki is not magic....... it is just co-ordination of mind and body. Looking at conflict as a way to create peace is a good idea. Mary\\nMitchMZ06-07-2005, 03:22 PMI would have to disagree with the statement that Ki is not a real thing. In every culture, there is a way to define this natural occurrance. Westerners tend to define in it a secular way, whereas I think Easterners tend to explain it in a spiritual way....either way, it makes sense. Now, if we merge the study of Ki/Chi with realistic training methods and techniques, I think an art becomes very effective. The only flaw I see with Aikido is the way some people practice it. The techniques have their validity, as does Ki. Applying them effectively comes down to how much we want to train and how we train. Don\\'t confuse your personal failures and the effectiveness of an entire system. That being said, I think there are a few things most dojos could do occassionally to solidify the effectiveness of their technique.\\nKeith_k06-07-2005, 03:28 PMRed Beetle, According to your website, you don\\'t practice aikido. Neither do I. Although I share your opinions on the role of ki and mysticism in the martial arts, I find it rude that you wish to impose this view on others. Mysticism is an integral part of Aikido. Those who practice Aikido gravitate to it for this reason, and those like you and me choose other arts with less emphasis on mysticism. If Aikidoka want to feel that they are in harmony with the universe and act with love and compassion as they inflict horrible pain (be it temporary or not) on an attacker, that is their business. I\\'m sure they have equally disdainful opinions about my willingness to strike an attacker full force in the face. I do not wish them to impose their philosophy on my art, as I do not impose mine upon theirs.

Yes, that\\'s a very good point. Interested in your take, Jun. My thought is that mysticism is one manifestation of the spiritual aspects of aikido. I like the definition of \"mysticism\" that I just found on dictionary.com: A belief in the existence of realities beyond perceptual or intellectual apprehension that are central to being and directly accessible by subjective experience. I\\'m sure there are many people out there who will say that they are not interested in anything but the physical \"put your partner\\'s butt onto the ground\" part of aikido. For them, I wouldn\\'t necessarily say that any sort of mysticism. That is why I said that I do not necessary agree that mysticism is an integral part of aikido. -- Jun, off to the dojo to have my butt put onto the ground\\nKeith_k06-07-2005, 06:35 PMHow is he imposing his views on others? He is just stating his views just like everyone else here. \"Imposing\" may have been too harsh a word, but in effect Mr. Red Beetle is saying that the idea of ki, and the philosophy behind aikido, is rubbish. It is one thing to comment of the effectiveness of technique, but philosophy is neither right nor wrong. For him to say that a certain philosophical approach to martial arts is wrong, is...well wrong. I feel that it would be analogous to going to a dedicated Christian forum and starting a thread that says there is no way that a person could rise from the grave and come back to forgive all your sins and you are are fools for believing it. It just seems out of place in a bad way. That\\'s an interesting statement, one with which I\\'m not too sure if I personally agree. But, to make sure we\\'re on the same starting page: How would you define \"mysticism\" in the context of your thoughts in this thread? I don\\'t believe in the concept of \"ki.\" The idea that there is some form of energy inside us and all around us that we can project from our bellies to our fingertips is a bit mystical to me. I may be wrong, but I think the idea of \"ki\" is integral to Aikido. \"Ki\" being a mystical concept, mysticism is integral to Aikido. IMHO of course. As for striking with the intent to do damage: I will concede that there are aikidoka who have no problem with my willingness to beat the crap out of my attacker if you concede that that are many who would have a problem with it.\\nMike Sigman06-07-2005, 06:40 PMMy thought is that mysticism is one manifestation of the spiritual aspects of aikido. (snip) I\\'m sure there are many people out there who will say that they are not interested in anything but the physical \"put your partner\\'s butt onto the ground\" part of aikido. My two cents is that there is some \"mysticism\" via Ueshiba in Aikido because of Shinto (animism), but there\\'s a misconception about the \"heavenly views\" in Asia among many westerners, particularly the New Age. The strong undercurrent that Ueshiba was drawing on was the Asian (read \"Chinese\", since they were the dominant power whom so many emulated) idea of there being a rationality to all things in the universe. In other words, there is an order, starting with the Yin-Yang explanation and developing in a logical progression. What many are interpreting as \"spirituality\", \"mysticism\", and \"religious call to love\" is actually more of an assurance that from the chaos there is an order of rationality. The Asian \"religions\" are justifying themselves on ORDER (read \"HARMONY\"), so \"mysticism\", in the western sense, is probably not quite accurate. My opinion.

You cant effectively stop fighting w/out knowing how to fight. I think this is the main idea of aikido. Although it is somewhat violent to learn aikido, it really IS love because it teaches you to use your skills to stop violence, and that shows love for other people.

Aikido class may be a place in which you can practice loving your neighbor, but Aikido is not love.\" No? Aikido is nothing but an expression of the spirit of Love for all living things. & The secret of aikido is to cultivate a spirit of loving protection for all things. from http://www.aikiweb.com/general/founder.html How does this relate to a sankyo that makes your eyes water, or an irimi-nage that feels like, well, nothing at all? I have no idea, but I am drawn to these ideals and embrace them as a fundamental under-pinning of Aikido.

Maybe you should, as well.\\neyrie06-07-2005, 08:19 PMHaving not seen the original Japanese quote \"Aikido is \\'love\\'\", I can\\'t really comment otherwise. But here\\'s a thought: Perhaps \"love\" (or at least what most people think of \"love\" in English) is not the right word??? The Chinese character for \"love\" is a composite pictogram depicting \"friends\" living under a \"roof\" with children, implying a harmonious relationship, based on friendship.

For what it is worth, my Sensei\\'s views (I share them , fancy that :D ) is that ki is a good term for good body mechanics, mental intention, and focus. I care little for the religion - based aspects of Aikido, but love the discipline of its form and find a lot of value in the traditions....kind of a mixed signals thing, eh? The ideal of, at least, ATTEMPTING to \"de-escalate\" violence, is at least a step in the right direction for anyone, regardless of martial art discipline that is followed. For what it is worth, I have no problem with hitting people, but am better able to NOT hit them from this training. Self control is everything. I guess it is only mystical in the sense that it came from another culture. More of an \"exotic\" thing Lan\\nakiy06-07-2005, 10:56 PMI don\\'t believe in the concept of \"ki.\" The idea that there is some form of energy inside us and all around us that we can project from our bellies to our fingertips is a bit mystical to me. I may be wrong, but I think the idea of \"ki\" is integral to Aikido. \"Ki\" being a mystical concept, mysticism is integral to Aikido. IMHO of course. Ah -- OK. Personally, I don\\'t equate the notion of \"ki\" with \"mysticism.\" Rather, I\\'d probably say that the kind of things that Mike Sigman writes about above (eg Shinto) would more fall along the lines of \"mysticism.\" There are elements of \"faith\" in budo training (and pretty much any other kind of endeavor), I think, though. Whether that\\'s \"mysticism\" or not would probably depend on the person considing it. As for striking with the intent to do damage: I will concede that there are aikidoka who have no problem with my willingness to beat the crap out of my attacker if you concede that that are many who would have a problem with it. Oh, of course I\\'d say that there are some folks out there in the world of aikido who have a problem with people who are willing to \"beat the crap\" out of someone. The same could probably be said about any martial art, but I\\'d guess that the percentage of those who have a problem with such is probably higher in aikido than, say, in krav maga. But, then again, I do know of at least one aikido T-shirt that states, \"We put the \\'harm\\' back into \\'harmony\\'\"... On the topic of \"aikido is love,\" the founder himself has said things like, \"the path of aikido is the path of protecting love,\" \"the path of aiki is the manifestation of love,\" and \"true aikido is \\'love\\'.\" (First two quotes from \"Takemusu Aiki\" and the last quote from \"Aikido\" (thanks, Peter!) both translated from the original Japanese by me.) The character used for \"love\" is, indeed, . Personally, I\\'m far from understanding what this really means, so I can\\'t say much about this topic. Any way, I wouldn\\'t say that aikido is unique in such thoughts. Even Kano sensei has written about the principle of \"jita kyoei\" (mutual welfare and benefit) for judo. I\\'m sure that those folks (myself included) who have been on the receiving end of some judo techniques will say that my impact with the earth (oof) sure didn\\'t feel so beneficial to my health! Yet, I can understand how the principle of \"jita kyoei\" comes through in the actual keiko and the shugyo. In any case, as far as the topic of those who have not taken aikido who wish to share their views, as long as they do so in a respecful manner that\\'s conducive to meaningul exchanges of thoughts, I\\'m fine with their participation. To conclude, I personally think that some interesting observations about aikido have been made by many folks in this thread. If anything, it\\'s an exercise to help delineate my own thoughts in the matter... Best, -- Jun\\nxuzen06-08-2005, 12:35 AMOnce I come across a Taoist saying:- Man follows the mandate (rules) of heaven; Heaven follows the mandate of the Way (Do or Tao); And the Way follows that which is natural. -Lao Tzu, a Taoist sage When I think abt this, I feel that aikido or any of the do art is a system of education that points to the direction of being natural or in compliance with what is natural or in harmony. Mysticism should not be attached to it. Mysticism denotes a very low level of intelligence to explain things. The concept of Ki or chi is IMO a concept that man develop to explain certain physical aspect that maybe modern science has yet to provide an answer. After more than 5,000 years, this term is still in use. I am wondering whether if we are so attached to this term or rather, if mankind still have need for this term/concept as we still have many issues that cannot be answered by conventional scientific knowledge. IMO Aikido is devoid of mysticism. It is only practitioners who attach mysticism or supernaturality to it. Hence it can be said mysticism is man-made not natural. FWIW and my two cents, Boon.\\nErik06-08-2005, 12:40 AMWhy not say, \"Baseball is love.\" , \"Golf is love.\", \"Nascar is love\", or whatever else someone decides love is to them. The word \\'love\\' quickly loses any meaning. If a word can mean anything, then it simply means nothing. This is done, indirectly, by certain individuals within sports. I doubt you hear it much in Nascar but you get it indirectly within golf and definitely within baseball although it\\'s presented differently. I bet you could also find it within hunting or similar activities. Aikidoists, however, seldom use those terms to refer to a sport or activity. Better to deride it for allowing competition. That being said, I agree and disagree with much of what you wrote. Morihei Ueshiba, as Don pointed out, clearly came from a mystical realm and seemingly bought into a lot of stuff I would frankly deem as crap. But, he was what he was and you can\\'t entirely disregard it. However, at the same time, trying to model everything: diet, no water during training, breathing exercises, etc. when you have no basis to define if any of it accomplishes anything seems dumb too. Maybe Ueshiba ate the diet he did because he couldn\\'t find a steak and with more protein in his diet he would have grown taller and been twice as good as he was? So we come along as the knuckleheads we are and eat a macrobiotic diet like Ueshiba did because, well, that\\'s what he did for a part of his life. And he was really good. And we want to be just like him. All the spiritual blather sometimes seems exactly the same to me, but you can\\'t just disregard it either, if only for a historical understanding of where the art came from.\\nCNYMike06-08-2005, 12:49 AM.... Lots of Aikido people run around talking about \"ki\", but the fact of the matter is that the teaching of \"ki\" is simply a mystical/magical teaching which conjures belief in superstitious nonsense. :p Students attempt to clear their minds, chant words or syllables, breath a certain way, assume postures, and so forth in the attempt to grasp or develop a magical power that is about as real as George Lucas\\' \"Force.\" :cool: Students and Teachers would do better spending their time in the examination of, and actual practice of technical skills, rather than pretending to direct a make believe power from their bowels to their fingers.

If a word can mean anything, then it simply means nothing. Aikido is not love. :yuck: Aikido is a Martial system. Aikido class may be a place in which you can practice loving your neighbor, but Aikido is not love. Towards the end of his life, O Sensei thought of traiding the \"Aiki\" characters that mean \"harmony\" to \"Aiki\" that means love. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido was a nice guy, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught was the source of this kindness. Just because a teacher, or a founder of Aikido claims that what he teaches will bring a moral harmony and love for mankind, this is no basis for concluding that what he taught actually accomplishes his claims. If a person was not familiar with Aikido, and its mystical teachings, do you really think that such a person would conclude that Aikido was the way of peaceful harmony just by watching a demonstration of Aikido projections or neutralizations? Of course not. They may be impressed, but no such moral assertion will be made from watching such a demonstration. The reason it would be impossible to deduce a moral principal from a visual or tangible demonstration is because you cannot start with something you see (Aikido demo), and end up with something you cannot see (moral ideas). One can practice ethics in Aikido class, but one cannot deduce ethics from Aikido. If ethics are taught at Aikido class, then they did not come from Iriminage or kotegaeshi, but from Asian philosophy or religion. Since that is clearly the case, why should I pay homage to such Asian religious philosophy? Why not some other religion? Why not deontology? Why not utilitarianism? If I want to go to church, why would I go to Aikido class? If I want to learn how not to fight, couldn\\'t I just ask an Amish person? Wouldn\\'t that be easier than all that physical combat training? Aikido is combat training isn\\'t it? The Amish manage not to fight without Aikido. The Amish manage to live in harmony without Aikido. Maybe Morihei Uyeshiba should have joined an Amish community instead of the religious school of Omoto-kyo. If you don\\'t need Aikido to live in harmony and peace with your neighbor, and clearly you don\\'t, then maybe Aikido doesn\\'t need Asian philosophy of religion in order to function. Maybe Aikido is simply a physical exercise that can be used in a self-defense situation. Except that the martial artist who did that would be guilty of being grossly disrepectuful to the founder, and failing to to his job of preserving and passing on what was passed to him. My Kali teacher, who also has permission to teach Pentjak Silat Serak, is constantly emphasizing his role as preserving the arts he is teaching. Martial arts is not just about teaching someone a skill -- it is about passing on part of a culture. That\\'s even true of Jun Fan/JKD; that\\'s why their terminology is in Cantonese. It may even be true of Western Boxing -- you just don\\'t notice the culture becaue we\\'re in it. WRT Serak, Andy always said, \"It is very important to do things exactly the way I show you,\" in no small part to show proper hormat or respect to the founder of the art, Pak Sera, and his disciples. I don\\'t see why this doesn\\'t apply to Aikido. You are not just teaching joint locks and throws -- you can learn those anywhere. You are getting a small part of Japanese culture that has been refracted through O Sensei\\'s vision. And if the \"mystical nonsense\" is an important part of what O Sensei wants passed down, then you\\'d damn well better pass it down, or you are not doing your job as an Aikido student/teacher. Yet it is very odd/dsiconcerting to come to Aikido, supposedly a \"traditional\" art, and find people 180 degrees from someone in the \"non-traditional\" arts WRT the role of preservation. I\\'ve had that drummed into me for over a year: That part of what we do is to preserve what we are given so it doens\\'t vanish from the face of the Earth. Aikido may have had fifty years to establish itself in the West, but that doesn\\'t make that job any less important. If you want to learn how to fight, don\\'t go to anyone for formal training in anything. Just move to a bad neighborhood and get in fights every day. Martial arts is about more than that. And if you can\\'t see that or refuse to accept it, then maybe you should ask yourself if you are doing the right thing with your disposable income.\\nKeith_k06-08-2005, 01:23 AMBut, then again, I do know of at least one aikido T-shirt that states, \"We put the \\'harm\\' back into \\'harmony\\'\"... That is excellent! Being that Hapkido and Aikido mean the same thing in their respective languages, I may just have to borrow that t-shit idea.\\nMichael Neal06-08-2005, 07:09 AMI don\\'t have a problem with spirituality and I don\\'t have a problem with people freely expressing their religious views. I just find it annoying and a bit pretentious when people use Aikido or any other martial art as a way to promote their religion when a great deal of people are there to learn a martial art.\\nian06-08-2005, 07:09 AMI always like the anecdote about aikido in which someone asks Ueshiba \"I would like to learn your aikido\", whereupon Ueshiba replies \"that\\'s funny, everyone else wants to learn their own aikido\". The point being that aikido is more of a personal exploration than a set standard. However, I agree that most mystesism (can\\'t spell!) is just stuff repeated by others, whereas in rare cases it does express a real understanding that cannot be put in conventional terms (for example, I consider ki to be a \\'model\\' of how things work, and one which is flawed, but is simpler for explaining many things). However, we must critically assess all the information which we obtain - and I believe that is a big problem with aikido. Technological advancement is not done specifically because people are clever, but because people can record knowledge for future generations, and future generations can critically appraise this (whether deductive reasoning or empirical reasoning). As an aikido community we need to get together and produce falsifiable hypotheses i.e. underlying fundamentals in aikido which can be tested and refined or rejected. We are still in a stage where different aikido clubs do radically different things, and there has been no effort to objectively assess the advantages and disadvantages (possibly because an assessment in the dojo is nothing like an assessment within real combat).\\nMike Sigman06-08-2005, 07:15 AMOn the topic of \"aikido is love,\" the founder himself has said things like, \"the path of aikido is the path of protecting love,\" \"the path of aiki is the manifestation of love,\" and \"true aikido is \\'love\\'.\" (First two quotes from \"Takemusu Aiki\" and the last quote from \"Aikido\" (thanks, Peter!) both translated from the original Japanese by me.) The character used for \"love\" is, indeed, . Personally, I\\'m far from understanding what this really means, so I can\\'t say much about this topic.I\\'ve never been exactly sure how to handle some of the things O-Sensei did toward the end of his life. He was emotionally erratic, often irrascible, and treated with kid-gloves because of his temper outbursts (not always was he like this, but enough so that it was a common conversation). He awarded a woman dance teacher a 10th dan in Aikido and was seen in public demonstrations with her... notice how it\\'s very difficult to find any mention of this in the literature. In other words, there was a certain amount of behavior and pronouncements that most of the Japanese surrounding O-Sensei sort of studiously avoid talking about. So when it gets down to the \"Aikido is Love\" part, I would have several questions about it, if I wanted to be sure I understood what he was talking about. First of all, I\\'d want to be sure that the \"love\" translation really equates to the concept of \"love\" that westerners are thinking about when they hear that term. Secondly, I\\'d want to know how old he was when he made that pronouncement. Thirdly, I\\'d look at the uchi-deshi of the time and see how much their training focuses on and mentions \"Aikido is love\".... if it\\'s not a big factor in what they say or train, then I wouldn\\'t put a lot of weight onto the \"Aikido is love\" idea. ;) FWIW Mike\\nSeiserL06-08-2005, 07:36 AMIMHO, Aikido is a tool, a discipline. It can be studied without the mysticism. But I personally like it.\\nMichael Neal06-08-2005, 08:15 AMI have found more personal spirituality practicing Judo than I ever did with Aikido, even though there is no discussion whatsoever of spirituality in my Judo class or after class for that matter. I guess what I am trying to say that spirituality is a personal experience, and while your religious experience can tranfer to all aspects of your life it is better to leave the practice of religion to church and your personal time. Outward religious practice certainly does not belong in a martial arts class. How would you like it if your sensei was a Catholic and they did Catholic religious rituals during class?\\nrob_liberti06-08-2005, 08:19 AMWhen I think about the idea: \"aikido is love\" - I think about what does \"aikido\" mean to me, and what does \"love\" mean to me, and I think about how to reconcile the two things. I think the mental materialism approach of \"I already know what aikido is, and I already know what love is, and they are not the same thing\" is not quite the point. It is directly against the message of \"shoshin\". This kind of topic reminds me of Plato\\'s \"forms\" - like what is \"justice\"? what is friendship? what is virtue? can virtue be taught? It might not be such a horrible thing to ask yourself now and again, things like: what is \"ki\"? what is \"aiki\"? what is \"do\"? what is \"ikkyo\"? what is \"iriminage\"? what is the \"wa\"? etc. Giving credit where credit is due, I would say that Mike Sigman has done a really good job with what is \"ki\"? I would love to read about some of the other ideas - I just mentioned - thought about to that degree or more. Rob\\nakiy06-08-2005, 09:03 AMHi MIchael, I don\\'t have a problem with spirituality and I don\\'t have a problem with people freely expressing their religious views. I just find it annoying and a bit pretentious when people use Aikido or any other martial art as a way to promote their religion when a great deal of people are there to learn a martial art. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, but I\\'m a bit lost. I\\'m not too sure if anyone here has said that aikido should contain religious teachings. Can you expand a bit on your thoughts about this? In what manners have you seen aikido people using aikido to promote their religion? -- Jun\\nMichael Neal06-08-2005, 09:49 AMJun, many are promoting Aikido as a Religion, and practically worhipping Ueshiba as a diety. Magical powers of Ki, absolute faith in magical like acts performed by Ueshiba even though they never experienced it themselves, etc. I can spend a bit of time here on Aikiweb collecting the quotes if you would like\\nMike Sigman06-08-2005, 09:53 AMJun, many are promoting Aikido as a Religion, and practically worhipping Ueshiba as a diety. C\\'mon, Michael.... he wasn\\'t THAT fat. ;) Mike\\nCNYMike06-08-2005, 10:56 AMJun, many are promoting Aikido as a Religion, and practically worhipping Ueshiba as a diety. Magical powers of Ki, absolute faith in magical like acts performed by Ueshiba even though they never experienced it themselves, etc. I can spend a bit of time here on Aikiweb collecting the quotes if you would like Mike, last fall I attended an anual seminar here in CNY with an Okimura Sensei, who started training under O Sensei in the 1950s and is also a Buddhist priest. So he should know whether Aikido is relgious or not. He said flat out, no ifs, ands, or buts, \"Aikido is not religion.\" That\\'s a quote. Make of that what you will.\\nRon Tisdale06-08-2005, 11:06 AMNone of the yoshinkan schools I know of practice aikido as religion. Maybe you just hang out in the wrong places.... :D Ron\\njonreading06-08-2005, 11:18 AMSeparation of Church and Class!? I have a very hard time with this same concept. So far, this is about all I can say: Religion exists in aikido because the founder was very religious (in many eyes fanatical). The interaction of religion and aikido is important to training because concepts, ideas, and philosophies of aikido are derived from religious beliefs; just as many physical techniques were derived from daito ryu. Aikido people are required to understand the religious interaction of aikido to excel in training; they are not required to believe it, live it, or do anything else with it. Aikido people are required to understand the physical interaction of aikido to excel in training; they are not required to practice it, live it, or do anything else with it. This is the balance of aikido. To remove the spiritual component would leave you with a collection of techniques that resemble daito ryu. To remove the physical component would leave you with religious doctrine. Together, you have a martial art called aikido. That said, I have found that aikido is growing in spiritual zealots unbalancing aikido practice. If taken out on context, many of O\\'Sensei\\'s comments would seem fanatical or mystical (heck, even taken in context some of his quotes and ideas are \"excentric\"). To that extent, I agree that we need to pay closer attention to what the aikido community protrays is aikido, but I don\\'t think that was the focus of the thread. Aikido a a budo; an ideology to improve life in all aspects, not just fighting...\\nMichael Neal06-08-2005, 11:23 AM ']\n",

Some adjustments in the grading scheme may be made in the interest of fair and uniform grading. In no case will grading be harsher than the above. Questions about grading should be brought to my attention as soon as possible. You will have one week after the item is returned to discuss your grade. Homework grading must be discussed with the Grader first. No grade will be changed after this one-week period.

Be forewarned that exams will be strictly timed. Automatic grade deductions will be made for turning them in late. Make-up exams will not be given. If you have a valid excuse (as determined by me) for missing a midterm, your final exam will grade will count 600 instead of 400 points. Homework\\nApproximately one per week. You are encouraged to discuss assignments with your colleagues after you have applied individual diligent effort. However, the work you turn in must be entirely your own. Homework assignments are intended to be practice to be certain that you understand the material. It is your chance to test what you know and to get feedback. Your best grade strategy is to attempt all of the assignments yourself before seeking help. The importance of homework in getting a good grade is far greater than the 20% weighting it receives in calculating your grade. Homework assignments will be graded on the basis of apparent effort, completeness, and clarity of presentation. Solutions will be posted in the Petroleum Engineering Reading Room and available for www or ftp download. You will be in charge of self-evaluating your homework solutions. Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late assignments will not be accepted, except in very rare, very serious, and unexpected circumstances. The chance of acceptance of late homework will be improved by checking with me beforehand. Attendance\\nClass attendance is not mandatory, however, the course includes a large amount of interpretative and explanatory material that will be presented only during lectures. If it is necessary for you to miss class, you should arrange to get class notes and handouts from someone in the class. Special Requirements\\nUniversity policy applies to dropping the course. Academic honesty is taken very seriously in this course. It is your responsibility to avoid situations where academic honesty can be a problem either for yourself or for those around you. Violations will be referred to the Dean of Students. The University of Texas at Austin provides, upon request, appropriate adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4241 TDD or the College of Engineering Director of Students with Disabilities at 471-4321. Course Evaluations\\nA course/instructor evaluation will be conducted during class time sometime the last week of class. The evaluation will be conducted by someone in the class and returned to the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering departmental office. Results will not be seen by the instructor until after grades have been turned in. All course/instructor evaluations are anonymous. The instructor welcomes feedback from students throughout the semester with regard to ways the course can be improved. In the event, however, that students wish to provide anonymous feedback, the Student Feedback Forum of the Cabinet of College Councils also offers students a line of communication with professors. Their URL:\\nhttp://ccwf.cc.utexas.edu/~cabinet/comments.html can be used to send anonymous feedback to any professor about a course. Please use this if you feel that you would like an anonymous form of communication with us during the semester. Course Objectives and Content\\nThis course is intended to explore advanced concepts in reservoir engineering. We will use as an important tool, reservoir simulation, in that we will apply reservoir simulation to a variety of problems, comparing results to those from other reservoir engineering methods. I.

      "[\" Social Detox APR OCT APR 24 2007 2008 2009 18 captures\\n18 Dec 07 - 4 Jan 14 Close\\nHelp Social Detox\\nProcess Not Product Social Detox at GermantownSkillshare\\nPosted in Uncategorized on September 26, 2008 by clover56 Last weekend a group of us gathered around a smoldering fire at Germantown Community Farm to discuss the role/responsibility of men in ending gender oppression. The discussion went in many directions as any HUGE expansive topic such as this one will facilitate. One amazing aspect of this discussion was the balance in participation. It seemed as though everyone had a lot to say and offer to the space, and I feel like I learned a lot. So I want to say thanks yall for putting on such an awesome weekend, a great dance, and for having so many great workshops and skillshares. And the food was amazing. I am for sure movin out to the countryside.\\nI wanted to take this space to share some of the discussion topics that came up. List style:\\n-How can men relate to feminism in sustainable ways? A point was made that so many mens groups have come together and men have started working on feminist projects, but then the groups fade away or someone drops the ball. Basically, how can men be involved and stay involved. What would that look like?\\n- Men often take up space in music that can interrupt or make the music dysfunctional. A woman expressed that playing music in a group of all women is a completely different experience than with a group of men. This topic spun off into some talk about listening skills. Which Ill say right now as a man thats something I need to be constantly aware of and working on.\\n- Childhood development and gender roles. We see kids growing up into sexist roles and acting out on them at a very young age. How can we subvert the mainstream messages and nurture a more creative and self-empowered expression of gender for kids?\\n- Struggle with maintaining boundaries around radical ideas in more mainstream spaces. At a worksite for example, a group of men talking in dis-respectful and sexist ways about women. How to interact with that as one of the guys. How to challenge that in ways that can be heard in such spaces without compromising values. Example; like acting aggressive to be heard in a group of men. How can this be done in ways that are not validating patriarchal behavior?\\n- We talked Mens experience with gender. Growing up, being molded, the peer pressure, sexuality, bullying, pornography, power, etc etc..\\n- How can men be active in resisting sexual assault, understanding the complexities of consent in our relationships and sexualities, and being accountable and supportive to survivors of sexual assault?\\n- What is the power or presence of a group of men hanging out together. What is the dynamic when a woman walks by? What about when a group of men and a woman cross paths on a sidewalk. Who steps aside? How does the attention shift in the group? How can these dynamic be handled in a way that is anti-sexist and aware of privilege?\\n- Positive masculinity. Whats it look like? There are many different male archetypes but how does this intersect with race and white supremacy? Who gets framed as the bad guys and who gets access to the good guy male performance.\\n- Queer masculinity/ Transmasculine expression. Expressing ones gender is an important and empowering part of queer and trans identity. How can a masculine expression be anti-sexist and accountable to folks who are so often silenced and oppressed by sexism.\\n- What makes power oppressive? Can we explore roles of power together in ways that are consensual? What about sharing power. Like contributing to eachothers self empowerment rather than competing in ways that deplete or take power away from others. How can power be shared and sustainable.\\n- How do women play into patriarchy? How can this be challenged on a personal level as well as a social level? What dynamics exist between women that can encourage or enable a sexist space?\\n- Some things that we can do immediately to challenge sexism in ourselves and community; ( I can only remember a few of the things we talked about. Our conversation spun in many ways) Share skills and information. Engage with people while teaching. Show someone how to do something and then let them do it themselves.\\nListen and self reflect on listening.\\nDont play guitar when someone is talking to you.\\nBe aware when your a guy in a group of guys. What kind of space youre takin up.\\nIf youre a guy and suddenly you find yourself walking closely behind a woman on the street, give her space. Stop to tie your shoe or cross the street or something.\\nDont validate sexist behavior in the workplace. Dont laugh at sexist jokes. Challenge that shit.\\nLearn how to be supportive of people by listening to their needs. Never decide how to take action on behalf of a woman whos been hurt or violated.\\nRead other lists of similar stuff or add to this one. 1 Comment SexualityEducation/Liberation\\nPosted in events with tags socialdetox, feminism, gender, anti-sexist, sexuality, sex positive, sex education, liberation, ghostcat, ithaca, ny, fingerlakes, potlucks on July 25, 2008 by clover56 This is the theme of a bi-weekly potluck that I host at Ghostcat Co-op where I live in Ithaca NY. The events are everyother thursday starting at 6pm. The past couple potlucks we discussed the many ways that we have all learned about sexuality growing up, all the influences and stuff that teach us about our bodies, identities, desires, and the basic how to do it. Attendance has been great, and this shows the real need that we have as a community to talk more about sex and to learn more and support eachother in this process.\\nIm really excited to announce that we will be continuing this potluck series through the fall and it is evolving into a class/skillshare type event with specific topics being taught by rotating teachers. There are fantastic heaps of sex-positive information in our community and room to expand it.\\nTo get on an e-mail / phone tree list for updates about the potlucks; contact me at Clover56 (at) riseup (dot) net Leave A Comment Earth FirstRondy\\nPosted in Uncategorized on July 16, 2008 by clover56 I just got back from the Earth First!

Its going to have no particular theme because trying to stick to a theme has kept me from making the zine. Instead its going to be a strange string of thoughts and connections. Hopefully it will be accessable and make sense and be a good follow up after the first zine. To contribute to the zine, please send stuff to me.\\nSome topic ideas for #2\\n-sexism makes your music sound like shit\\n-personal stories from men around ithaca\\n-interview with me (ryan clover) about the project\\n-accountability and sexual assault\\n-consent and sex education\\n-liberal new age sexual predators Leave A Comment Notworking\\nPosted in Uncategorized on March 15, 2008 by clover56 I regret to say that the Mens Discussion Freeskool class is not working for me. There have been a variety of struggles to get things together here in ithaca, and there hasnt been enough support for this project. Its ended up with just a few people trying to find time to get together, and never getting around to it. Im ashamed to even admit this because I feel somewhat responsible for its dysfunction, but Im learning and processing so much and really, nobody RSVP for the class.\\nSo in my life, most of the real work and processing of these issues is happening at my house (ghostcat). Theres 3 of us, all guys, and we process so much together, and have good supportive friendships. Its providing us with a space to encounter gender issues and work through stuff but still, theres something we need in the Anarchist Community at large and thats more action toward creating safer spaces and more action to confront sexism and deal with it.\\nI was traveling around a bit last month and met some guys who were trying to organize mens anti-sexist groups They seemed to be having the same struggle. They could have their meetings, but people were too inconsistent, so there was never any carry over. To be radical and work toward liberation, perhaps we need to emphasize a consistent process rather than a meeting. Perhaps we need to save the meetings for times when were planning something, or dealing with an issue that came up. In the meantime, we can always have conversations about gender, about unlearning oppressive behavior, about developing good communication skills and relationships. I want to write more on this later.\\nI feel like im opening up a whole new space on this blog to write like this in the first person and all But thats my goal right now.

      "[' THE LAW SOCIETY OF SCOTLAND EXAMINATION SYLLABUS AND READING LIST Revised DECEMBER 2004 2 CONTENTS Pages GUIDELINES 3 PUBLIC LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM 5 CONVEYANCING 6 SCOTS PRIVATE LAW 7 EVIDENCE 9 SCOTS CRIMINAL LAW 10 TAXATION 11 EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW 13 SCOTS COMMERCIAL LAW 14 * ACCOUNTING 16 * PROCEDURE 17 * PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 19 BOOKS PERMITTED IN EXAMINATION HALL 20 * These subjects are examined as part of the Diploma in Legal Practice course For a general introduction to the study of law, students might find it helpful to read Learning the Law by Glanville Williams (12th ed. 2002 - Sweet and Maxwell) and Studying Scots Law by Hector MacQueen (3rd ed. 2004) (Lexis Nexis) 3 GUIDELINES 1. References and Sources For general reading, candidates may find it useful to have to hand a copy of Glanville Williams Learning the Law (12th ed, 2002 - Sweet and Maxwell) and Hector MacQueens Studying Scots Law (3rd ed, 2004) published by Lexis Nexis. All candidates should have in their possession a copy of the syllabus and reading list for the relevant examination. The texts listed form the basis of the study materials for each subject. Candidates should note that while the textbooks cited on the reading lists are the latest editions there are often case or statutory developments subsequent to the publication of the text. Candidates will be expected to be aware of any such developments. 2. Examination Procedures Candidates must enrol for the examination no later than FOUR weeks before it takes place. The appropriate fee is payable at the time of registration (currently 40 for a first attempt and 60 for any subsequent attempt). No more than four attempts at any one exam will be allowed. Candidates undertaking the Law Society of Scotland examinations as part of their pre-Diploma training have four years from the date of the first exam on which to pass all the Law Society examinations. Instructions about the location of the examination hall and any other arrangements for the examination will be issued approximately one week before the examination takes place. Candidates should note that if there are any extenuating circumstances of which they wish the examiner to have regard, a letter should be submitted to the Law Society of Scotlands Education and Training department in advance of the examination. Candidates are reminded that no books, notes or other items are allowed in the examination room apart from those items specifically provided for in the subject reading lists. Only material with no additions made to the published text may be used. Highlighting is permitted, as are place markers, provided that these bear no inscription other than the name of the subject area being marked. Answers should be fully reasoned with appropriate citation of authorities. Candidates are required to write legibly. If an examiner is unable to read a candidates handwriting he or she will deduct marks, or may require to fail that candidate. No extra sittings will be permitted to candidates who fail as a result of illegible handwriting. 3. Pass Mark The pass mark for each paper is 50%. It should be noted that, where a paper consists of two or more sections, the overall pass mark is 50% with the candidate requiring to achieve a mark in each section of at least 45%. Distinction is awarded for marks of 75% and above. 4 4. Oral Examinations and Intimation of Results Oral examinations are held approximately 30 days after the written examination. It is solely at the discretion of the examiner to decide whether a particular candidate should be offered an oral examination, but, generally speaking, borderline fails may be offered an oral examination. The oral examination may cover any aspect of the syllabus for that subject but is likely to concentrate on the questions contained in the examination paper. Results can be revealed to candidates only after the meeting of the Board of Examiners at which the results are ratified. The Law Society will forward feedback forms to those candidates who fail. Any candidate requiring further guidance should write in the first instance to the Law Society of Scotlands Education and Training department and the enquiry will be directed to the relevant examiner. Any queries regarding course content will be dealt with in a similar way. Candidates should be aware that the Examiners decision is final and that there is no right of appeal other than on procedural grounds. 5. Moderator Where it is alleged that the examination process has been defective, the Board of Examiners has the power to appoint a suitable person to act as a moderator. The moderator will investigate the complaint and report to the Board of Examiners who may take such action as they consider appropriate in the light of the moderators report. 6. Exemptions Applicants seeking exemption should contact the Education and Training Department of the Law Society of Scotland for guidance on what information/documentation is required by the Law Societys Examiners. After having contacted the Law Society for guidance, applications for exemptions should be made in writing to the Law Society of Scotlands Education and Training department and should specify the subjects in which exemption is sought. Applications will be considered only when all required documentation has been received. Applications for exemption should be submitted to the Society no later than 6 weeks before the examination date. Late applications will not be considered. Exemptions are granted by the Law Society of Scotlands Examiners. If an applicant seeks more than four exemptions the matter will be referred to the Law Societys Admissions Committee with a recommendation from the Examiners. 5PUBLIC LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM (One paper of 3 hours) SYLLABUS General 1.

      "[' 1 The Faculty Reading Lists for Part I papers are revised annually to a greater or lesser extent. In designing examinations, setters take into account both reading lists operative during a two-year period. HISTORICAL TRIPOS PART I PAPER 8 & PAPER 7 c.1050-1150 READING LIST FOR ENGLISH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY c.1050-1500 Please note that this list is neither prescriptive nor comprehensive. It does not constitute a syllabus. It is intended primarily for supervisors, especially those just starting to teach the subject, to act as a guide to the scope of the subject and the range of the reading-matter available. The reading lists are deliberately wide-ranging and extensive so that they can form a basis from which supervisors coming new to a topic can construct their own shorter supervision reading-lists. While the list is not intended to be an official reading-list for undergraduates, students will be encouraged to obtain a copy (from the Faculty Office), as it may draw their attention to subjects they had not thought of studying for their weekly essays and further reading which they might find of interest. For the part of Paper 7 up to the Conquest, there is a list, covering all aspects of Anglo-Saxon history, obtainable from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. Copies of this are available from the History Faculty Office. Examples of Tripos questions and illustrations of ways in which topics are sometimes combined can be found by reference to past Tripos papers (available in the U.L., the Seeley Library and most college libraries) Please would you draw the list to the attention of anybody you know to be teaching this paper for the first time. Any comments, suggestions and amendments should be sent to Professor John Hatcher, Corpus Christi College, for sections 1 13 and Dr Christine Carpenter, New Hall, for sections 14 - 32. 2 READING LIST FOR ENGLISH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY c. 1066-1500 1 Demography and Population Studies 2 Prices, Wages and Standards of living 3 Population, Resources and Economic Development 4 Women in Town and Countryside 5 Eleventh-Century England and Domesday Book a) General b) Rural and agrarian c) Towns, trade and industry 6 Rural Society and the Agrarian Economy 1100-1500 a) Introductory and general b) Estate and regional studies c) Rural social structure and village communities d) Land market, family structures and social differentiation e) Freedom and villeinage f) Landlords: incomes, consumption and investment g) Farming practices and techniques h) Estate management 7 Economic Trends a) The twelfth century b) 1200-1350 c) Population pressure and standards of living 1275-1348 d) The Black Death e) The Later Middle Ages 8 Popular Discontent 9 The Peasants\\' Revolt 10 Towns a) Introductory and general b) Town histories c) Town government and society d) Late medieval towns 11 Industries and Industrial Organisation a) Gilds and crafts b) Cloth industry c) Mining d) Miscellaneous industries 12 Trade, Markets and Merchants a) Overseas trade b) Markets and internal trade c) Merchants and credit d) Jews and the economy 13 Archaeology 3 14 Crime, Criminals and Policing a) Law enforcement and legal administration b) Law and society c) Particular studies 15 Outlaw Literature a) Texts b) Discussion 16 Lay Literacy a) Medieval studies b) Comparative studies from other periods 17 Education a) Primary and secondary schooling b) The Universities 18 The monastic orders in England 1066-1200 a) Monasticism in Europe b) In England 19 The Friars 20 The English church in the later middle ages a) General b) Particular studies 21 Lay Piety a) Church and society b) Texts and other sources 22 John Wyclif and Lollardy a) Wyclif b) Wyclif and Lollardy 23 The Family and Marriage in England c. 1250-1500 a) General b) The aristocratic family c) Merchants and townsmen (and women) d) The peasant family e) Gender and masculinity 24 The Structure of Land Owning Society c. 1066-1500 a) Barons and knights b) \\'The crisis of the knightly class\\' c) Nobles and gentry 25 \\'Feudalism\\' a) The \\'Old\\' debate b) The \\'New\\' re-evaluation c) Studies of individual baronies 26 Bastard Feudalism a) General b) Individual affinities c) Crime, conflict and settlement d) Local studies 4 27 Aristocratic Values and Consumption Patterns c.1066-1500 a) Chivalry c. 1066-1500 b) Consumption patterns of lay landowners c.1200-1500 28 Social Mobility a) General b) Into and within nobility and gentry c) Lawyers and administrators d) Merchants and townsmen e) Peasants and yeomen 29 Aliens in English Society 30 Poverty and Charity 31 Intellectual Developments 1050-1300 32 The Arts in England c.1066-1500 a) Architecture b) Sculpture, precious metals etc. c) Painting and Illumination d) Literature e) Music f) General discussions and problems in patronage 5 General and Introductory Works M.M.

KREMENS, etc., et al., Appellants,v.Kevin BARTLEY et al.\\nNo. 75-1064.\\nArgued Dec. 1, 1976.\\nDecided May 16, 1977. Syllabus\\nAppellees, five mentally ill individuals who were between 15 and 18 years old at the time the complaint was filed, were the named plaintiffs in an action challenging the constitutionality of a 1966 Pennsylvania statute governing the voluntary admission and voluntary commitment to state mental health institutions of persons aged 18 or younger. Appellees sought to vindicate their constitutional rights and to represent a class consisting of all persons under 18 \"who have been, are, or, may be admitted or committed\" to state mental health facilities. The statute provided, inter alia, that a juvenile might be admitted upon a parent\\'s application, and that, unlike an adult, the admitted person was free to withdraw only with the consent of the parent admitting him. After the commencement of the action, regulations were promulgated substantially increasing the procedural safeguards afforded minors aged 13 or older. After those regulations had become effective, and notwithstanding the differentiation therein between juveniles of less than 13 and those 13 to 18, the District Court certified the class to be represented by the plaintiffs as consisting of all persons 18 or younger who have been or may be admitted or committed to Pennsylvania mental health facilities pursuant to the challenged provisions. The District Court later issued a decision holding those provisions violative of due process. In July 1976, after that decision, and after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction, a new statute was enacted, repealing the provisions held to be unconstitutional except insofar as they relate to the mentally retarded. Under the 1976 Act a person 14 or over may voluntarily admit himself, but his parents may not do so; thus those 14 to 18 who were subject to commitment by their parents under the 1966 Act are treated as adults by the 1976 Act. Children 13 and younger may still be admitted for treatment by a parent. Those 14 and over may withdraw from voluntary treatment by giving written notice. Those under 14 may be released on the parent\\'s request, and \"any responsible party\" may petition for release. Held:\\n1. The enactment of the 1976 Act, which completely repealed and replaced the challenged provisions vis-a-vis the named appellees, clearly moots the claims of the named appellees, who are treated as adults totally free to leave the hospital and who cannot be forced to return unless they consent to do so. Pp. 128-129.\\n2. The material changes in the status of those included in the class certified by the District Court that resulted from the 1976 Act and the regulations preclude an informed resolution of that class\\' constitutional claims. Pp. 129-133.\\n(a) Though the mootness of the claims of named plaintiffs does not \"inexorably\" require dismissal of the claims of the unnamed members of the class, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532; Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444, this Court has never adopted a flat rule that the mere fact of certification by a district court requires resolution of the merits of the claims of the unnamed members of the class when those of the named parties had become moot. Pp. 129-130.\\n(b) Here the status of all members of the class, except those individuals who are younger than 13 and mentally retarded, has changed materially since this suit began; the intervening legislation has fragmented the class. The propriety of the class certification is thus a matter of gravest doubt. Cf. Indianapolis School Comm\\'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74. Pp. 130-133.\\n(c) Moreover, the issue in this case with respect to a properly certified class is not one that is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Sosna, supra, distinguished. P. 133.\\n3. Since none of the critical factors that might allow adjudication of the claims of a class after mootness of the named plaintiffs are present here, the case must be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration of the class definition, exclusion of those whose claims are moot, and substitution of class representatives with live claims. Pp. 133-135. 402 F.Supp. 1039, vacated and remanded.\\nNorman J. Watkins, Harrisburg, Pa., for the appellants by Bernard G. Segal, Philadelphia, Pa., for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\\nDavid Ferleger, Philadelphia, Pa., for the appellees.\\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court. 1\\n* Appellees Bartley, Gentile, Levine, Mathews, and Weand were the named plaintiffs in a complaint challenging the constitutionality of Pennsylvania statutes governing the voluntary admission and voluntary commitment to Pennsylvania mental health institutions of persons 18 years of age or younger. The named plaintiffs alleged that they were then being held at Haverford State Hospital, a Pennsylvania mental health facility, and that they had been admitted or committed pursuant to the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 50, 4101 et seq. (1969). Various state and hospital officials were named as defendants.1 2\\nPlaintiffs sought to vindicate not only their own constitutional rights, but also sought to represent a class consisting of 3\\n\"all person under eighteen years of age who have been, are, or, may be admitted or committed to Haverford State Hospital and all other state mental health facilities under the challenged provisions of the state statute.\" App. 10a-11a (complaint, P 7). 4\\nA three-judge United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania struck down the statutes as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 402 F.Supp. 1039 (1975). The court also entered a broad order requiring the implementation of detailed procedural protections for those admitted under the Pennsylvania statutes. On December 15, 1975, this Court granted appellants\\' application for a stay of the judgment of the District Court. On March 22, 1976, we noted probable jurisdiction. 424 U.S. 964, 96 S.Ct. 1457, 47 L.Ed.2d 731. 5\\nIn general, the 1966 Act, which has been superseded to a significant degree, provides for three types of admission to a mental health facility for examination, treatment, and care: voluntary admission or commitment ( 402 and 403), emergency commitment ( 405), and civil court commitment ( 406). At issue here was the constitutionality of the voluntary admission and commitment statutes,2 402 and 403, as those statutes regulate the admission of persons 18 years of age or younger. The statutes3 provide that juveniles may be admitted upon the application of a parent, guardian, or individual standing in loco parentis and that, unlike adults, the admitted person is free to withdraw only with the consent of the parent or guardian admitting him.4 6\\nThere have been two major changes in the Pennsylvania statutory scheme that have materially affected the rights of juveniles: the promulgation of regulations under the 1966 Act, and the enactment of the Mental Health Procedures Act in 1976. At the time the complaint was filed, the 1966 Act made little or no distinction between older and younger juveniles. Each of the named plaintiffs was at that time between 15 and 18 years of age. After the commencement of this action, but before class certification or decision on the merits by the District Court, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare promulgated regulations which substantially increased the procedural safeguards afforded to minors 13 years of age or older. The regulations, promulgated pursuant to statutory authority,5 became effective September 1, 1973. The major impact of the regulations6 upon this litigation stems from the fact that the regulations accord significant procedural protections to those 13 and older, but not to those less than 13. The older juveniles are given notification of their rights, the telephone number of counsel, and the right to institute a 406 involuntary commitment proceeding in court within two business days. Under 406,7 a judicial hearing is held after notice to the parties. The younger juveniles are not given the right to a hearing and are still remitted to relying upon the admitting parent or guardian. 7\\nAlthough the regulations sharply differentiate between juveniles of less than 13 years of age and those 13 to 18, on April 29, 1974, the District Court nonetheless certified the following class to be represented by the plaintiffs: 8\\n\"This action shall be maintained as a class action under Rule 23(b)(1) and (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of the class comprised of all persons eighteen years of age or younger who have been, are or may be admitted or committed to mental health facilities in Pennsylvania pursuant to the challenged provisions of the state mental health law (i. e., 50 P.S. 4402 and 4403). This definition of the class is without prejudice to the possibility that it may be amended or altered before the decision on the merits herein.\" App. 270a. 9\\nOn July 9, 1976, after the decision below and after this Court had noted probable jurisdiction, Pennsylvania enacted a new statute substantially altering its voluntary admission procedures. Mental Health Procedures Act, Pa. Act No. 143. The new Act completely repeals the provisions declared unconstitutional below except insofar as they relate to mentally retarded persons. 502. Under the new Act, any person 14 years of age or over may voluntarily admit himself, but his parents may not do so; those 14 to 18 who were subject to commitment by their parents under the 1966 Act, are treated essentially as adults under the new Act. 201.8 Under the new Act children 13 and younger may still be admitted for treatment by a parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis. Ibid. Those 14 and over may withdraw from voluntary treatment \"at any time by giving written notice.\" 206(a).9 Those under 14 may be released by request of the parent; in addition, \"any responsible party\" may petition the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas to request withdrawal of the child or modification of his treatment. 206(b). 10\\nBecause we have concluded that the claims of the named appellees are mooted by the new Act, and that the claims of the unnamed members of the class are not properly presented for review, we do not dwell at any length upon the statutory scheme for voluntary commitment in Pennsylvania or upon the rationale of the District Court\\'s holding that the 1966 Act and regulations did not satisfy due process. II 11\\nThis case presents important constitutional issues issues that were briefed and argued before this Court. However, for reasons hereafter discussed, we conclude that the claims of the named appellees are mooted by the new Act and decline to adjudicate the claims of the class certified by the District Court. That class has been fragmented by the enactment of the new Act and the promulgation of the regulations. 12\\nConstitutional adjudication being a matter of \"great gravity and delicacy,\" see Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 345, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), we base our refusal to pass on the merits on \"the policy rules often invoked by the Court \\'to avoid passing prematurely on constitutional questions. Because (such) rules operate in \"cases confessedly within (the Court\\'s) jurisdiction\" . . . they find their source in policy, rather than purely constitutional, considerations.\\' \" Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 756 n. 8, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 1260, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976). A. 13\\nAt the time the complaint was filed, each of the named plaintiffs was older than 14, and insofar as the record indicates, mentally ill.10 The essence of their position was that, as matters stood at that time, a juvenile 18 or younger could be \"voluntarily\" admitted upon application of his parent, over the objection of the juvenile himself. Thus, appellees urged in their complaint that the Due Process Clause required that they be accorded the right to a hearing, as well as other procedural protections to ensure the validity of the commitment. App. 21a-22a, (complaint P 46). 14\\n(1-3) The fact that the Act was passed after the decision below does not save the named appellees\\' claims from mootness. There must be a live case or controversy before this Court, Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402, 95 S.Ct. 553, 558, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), and we apply the law as it is now, not as it stood below. Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 95 S.Ct. 533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975); Sosna v. Iowa, supra. Thus the enactment of the new statute11 clearly moots the claims of the named appellees, and all others 14 or older and mentally ill. 15\\nThese concerns were eradicated with the passage of the new Act, which applied immediately to all persons receiving voluntary treatment. 501. The Act, in essence, treats mentally ill juveniles 14 and older as adults. They may voluntarily commit themselves, but their parents may not do so, 201, and one receiving voluntary treatment may withdraw at any time by giving written notice. 206. With respect to the named appellees, the Act completely repealed and replaced the statutes challenged below, and obviated their demand for a hearing, and other procedural protections, since the named appellees had total freedom to leave the hospital, and could not be forced to return absent their consent. After the passage of the Act, in no sense were the named appellees \"detained and incarcerated involuntarily in mental hospitals,\" as they had alleged in the complaint, App. 21a. B 16\\nIf the only appellees before us were the named appellees, the mootness of the case with respect to them would require that we vacate the judgment of the District Court with instructions to dismiss their complaint. United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950). But as we have previously indicated, the District Court certified, pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23, the class described supra, at 125-126. 17\\n(4, 5) In particular types of class actions this Court has held that the presence of a properly certified class may provide an added dimension to our Art. III analysis, and that the mootness of the named plaintiffs\\' claims does not \"inexorably\" require dismissal of the action. Sosna, supra, 419 U.S., at 399-401, 95 S.Ct., at 557-558. See also Franks v. Bowman Transportation, Inc., supra, 424 U.S., at 752-757, 96 S.Ct., at 1258-1260; Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110-111, n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 854, 861, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). But we have never adopted a flat rule that the mere fact of certification of a class by a district court was sufficient to require us to decide the merits of the claims of unnamed class members when those of the named parties had become moot. Cf. Sosna, supra, 419 U.S., at 402, 95 S.Ct., at 558. Here, the promulgation of the regulations materially changed, prior to class certification, the controverted issues with respect to a large number of unnamed plaintiffs; prior to decision by this Court, the controverted issues pertaining to even more unnamed plaintiffs have been affected by the passage of the 1976 Act. We do not think that the fragmented residual of the class originally certified by the District Court may be treated as were the classes in Sosna and Franks. 18\\nThere is an obvious lack of homogeneity among those unnamed members of the class originally certified by the District Court. Analysis of the current status of the various subgroups reveals a bewildering lineup of permutations and combinations. As we parse it, the claims of those 14 and older and mentally ill are moot. They have received by statute all that they claimed under the Constitution. Those 14 and older and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act, struck down by the District Court, but are afforded the protections of the regulations. Their claims are not wholly mooted, but are satisfied in many respects by the regulations. Those 13 and mentally ill are subject to the admissions procedures of the new Act, arguably supplemented by the procedural protection of the regulations. The status of their claims is unclear. Those 13 and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Their claims are satisfied in many respects. Those younger than 13 and mentally ill are unaided by the regulations and are subject to the admissions procedures of the 1976 Act, the constitutional effect of which has not been reviewed by the District Court. Those younger than 13 and mentally retarded are subject to the 1966 Act, unaffected by the regulations. This latter group is thus the only group whose status has not changed materially since the outset of the litigation. These fragmented subclasses are represented by named plaintiffs whose constitutional claims are moot, and it is the attorneys for these named plaintiffs who have conducted the litigation in the District Court and in this Court.12 19\\nThe factors which we have just described make the class aspect of this litigation a far cry indeed from that aspect of the litigation in Sosna and in Franks, where we adjudicated the merits of the class claims notwithstanding the mootness of the claims of the named parties. In Sosna, the named plaintiff had by the time the litigation reached this Court fulfilled the residency requirement which she was challenging, but the class described in the District Court\\'s certification remained exactly the same. In that case, mootness was due to the inexorable passage of time, rather than to any change in the law. In Franks, a Title VII discrimination lawsuit, the named plaintiff had been subsequently discharged for a nondiscriminatory reason, and therefore before this Court that plaintiff no longer had a controversy with his employer similar to those of the unnamed members of the class. But the metes and bounds of each of those classes remained the same; the named plaintiff was simply no longer within them. 20\\nHere, by contrast, the metes and bounds of the class certified by the District Court have been carved up by two changes in the law. In Sosna and Franks, the named plaintiffs had simply \"left\" the class, but the class remained substantially unaltered. In both of those cases, the named plaintiff\\'s mootness was not related to any factor also affecting the unnamed members of the class. In this case, however, the class has been both truncated and compartmentalized by legislative action; this intervening legislation has rendered moot not only the claims of the named plaintiffs but also the claims of a large number of unnamed plaintiffs.13 The legislation, coupled with the regulations, has in a word materially changed the status of those included within the class description. 21\\n(6) For all of the foregoing reasons, we have the gravest doubts whether the class, as presently constituted, comports with the requirements of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(a).14 And it is only a \"properly certified\" class that may succeed to the adversary position of a named representative whose claim becomes moot. Indianapolis School Com\\'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1975). 22\\nIn addition to the differences to which we have already adverted, the issues presented by these appellees, unlike that presented by the appellant in Sosna, supra, are not \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" In the latter case there is a significant benefit in according the class representative the opportunity to litigate on behalf of the class, since otherwise there may well never be a definitive resolution of the constitutional claim on the merits by this Court. We stated in Franks that \"(g)iven a properly certified class action, . . . mootness turns on whether, in the specific circumstances of the given case at the time it is before this Court, an adversary relationship sufficient to fulfill this function exists.\" 424 U.S., at 755-756, 96 S.Ct., at 1260. We noted that the \"evading review\" element was one factor to be considered in evaluating the adequacy of the adversary relationship in this Court. Id., at 756 n. 8, 96 S.Ct., at 1260. In this case, not only is the issue one that will not evade review, but the existence of a \"properly certified class action\" is dubious, and the initial shortcomings in the certification have multiplied. See Indianapolis School Comm\\'rs v. Jacobs, supra. 23\\nIn sum, none of the critical factors that might require us to adjudicate the claims of a class after mootness of the named plaintiff\\'s claims are present here. We are dealing with important constitutional issues on the merits, issues which are not apt to evade review, in the context of mooted claims on the part of all of the named parties and a certified class which, whatever the merits of its original certification by the District Court, has been fragmented by the enactment of legislation since that certification. While there are \"live\" disputes between unnamed members of portions of the class certified by the District Court, on the one hand, and appellants, on the other, these disputes are so unfocused as to make informed resolution of them almost impossible. Cf. Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 95 S.Ct. 533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1976). We accordingly decline to pass on the merits of appellees\\' constitutional claims.15 24\\nWe conclude that before the \"live\" claims of the fragmented subclasses remaining in this litigation can be decided on the merits, the case must be remanded to the District Court for reconsideration of the class definition, exclusion of those whose claims are moot, and substitution of class representatives with live claims. 25\\nBecause the District Court will confront this task on remand, we think it not amiss to remind that court that it is under the same obligation as we are to \"stop, look, and listen\" before certifying a class in order to adjudicate constitutional claims. That court, in its original certification, ignored the effect of the regulations promulgated by appellants which made a dramatic distinction between older and younger juveniles,16 and, according to the District Court, 402 F.Supp., at 1042, accorded the named appellees all of the protections which they sought, save two: the right to a precommitment hearing, and the specification of the time for the postcommitment hearing. 26\\nThis distinction between older and younger juveniles, recognized by state administrative authorities (and later by the Pennsylvania Legislature in its enactment of the 1976 Act), emphasizes the very possible differences in the interests of the older juveniles and the younger juveniles. Separate counsel for the younger juveniles might well have concluded that it would not have been in the best interest of their clients to press for the requirement of an automatic precommitment hearing, because of the possibility that such a hearing with its propensity to pit parent against child might actually be antithetical to the best interest of the younger juveniles. In the event that these issues are again litigated before the District Court, careful attention must be paid to the differences between mentally ill and mentally retarded, and between the young and the very young. It may be that Pennsylvania\\'s experience in implementing the new Act will shed light on these issues. III 27\\n(7) This disposition is made with full recognition of the importance of the issues, and of our assumption that all parties earnestly seek a decision on the merits. As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his famous concurrence in Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S., at 345, 56 S.Ct., at 482: 28\\n\"The fact that it would be convenient for the parties and the public to have promptly decided whether the legislation assailed is valid, cannot justify a departure from these settled rules . . . .\" 29\\nAnd, as we have more recently observed in the context of \"ripeness\": 30\\n\"All of the parties now urge that the \\'conveyance taking\\' issues are ripe for adjudication. However, because issues of ripeness involve, at least in part, the existence of a live \\'Case or Controversy,\\' we cannot rely upon concessions of the parties and must determine whether the issues are ripe for decision in the \\'Case or Controversy\\' sense. Further, to the extent that questions of ripeness involve the exercise of judicial restraint from unnecessary decision of constitutional issues, the Court must determine whether to exercise that restraint and cannot be bound by the wishes of the parties.\" Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 138, 95 S.Ct. 335, 356, 42 L.Ed.2d 320 (1974). (Footnote omitted.) 31\\n(8) Our analysis of the questions of mootness and of our ability to adjudicate the claims of the class in this case is consistent with the long-established rule that this Court will not \"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\" Liverpool, N. Y. & P. S. S. Co. v. Emigration Comm\\'rs, 113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 355, 28 L.Ed. 899 (1885). The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 32\\nIt is so ordered. 33\\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting. 34\\nAs was true three Terms ago with respect to another sensitive case brought to this Court, I can \"find no justification for the Court\\'s straining to rid itself of this dispute.\" DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 349, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1722, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting). \"Although the Court should, of course, avoid unnecessary decisions of constitutional questions, we should not transform principles of avoidance of constitutional decisions into devices for sidestepping resolution of difficult cases.\" Id., at 350, 94 S.Ct., at 1722. 35\\nPursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23, the District Court, on April 29, 1974, certified appellee class consisting of persons 18 years of age or younger who are or may be committed to state mental facilities under Pennsylvania\\'s Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966. The State not only did not then oppose the certification, but to this day urges that this Court render a decision on the \"important constitutional issues . . . that were briefed and argued before this Court.\" Ante, at 127. Over a score of amici curiae organizations and parties similarly joined in presenting their views to us. Ordinarily of course, the defendant\\'s failure to object to a class certification waives any defects not related to the \"cases or controversies\" requirement of Art. III, cf. O\\'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494-495, 94 S.Ct. 669, 675, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974), and would require us to proceed to the merits of the dispute. 36\\nThe Court pointedly does not suggest that the class definition suffers from constitutionally based jurisdictional deficiencies. Instead, its analysis follows a different route. We are first told that it is likely1 that the claims of the named class members are moot. After several pages in which the Court parses decisions like Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), and Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976), for selected clauses and phrases, thereby attempting to distinguish the present case from those earlier decisions where class claims were allowed to reach decision, the opinion ultimately concludes that in their present posture the legal claims of the class members \"are so unfocused as to make informed resolution of them almost impossible\", ante, at 134, citing Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 95 S.Ct. 533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975). Accordingly, the Court \"decline(s) to pass on the merits of appellees\\' constitutional claims\", ante, at 134, and remands to the District Court for clarification of the class certification. 37\\nWhat does all this mean? Most importantly, the Court\\'s class-action analysis must be placed in proper perspective, for it is obvious that the Court\\'s extended discussion of Sosna, Franks, and like cases is a mere camouflage of dicta bearing no relationship to the disposition of this case. Those earlier cases merely recognized the continued existence of Art. III jurisdiction notwithstanding the subsequent mootness of the claims of the named parties to a class action. They said nothing about this Court\\'s discretionary authority to remand a class claim or any other claim to the lower courts for needed clarification. Thus, in the present case, the fact that the claims of the named plaintiffs may or may not be mooted, ante, at 128-129, is irrelevant, for, if the condition of the record so requires, a remand to clarify matters necessary to permit proper consideration of the issues in this appeal would be warranted regardless of whether the named parties remained in the case. Similarly, the Court\\'s various suggestions that these named plaintiffs \"left\" the class in a manner distinguishable from those in Sosna and Franks, ante, at 132, and that the issues presented herein are \"not capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" ante, at 133, are without meaning. This Court\\'s power to remand cases as in Fusari v. Steinberg is in no way dependent on these factors, and is not foreclosed by the existence of Art. III jurisdiction as found in Franks, Sosna, and their progeny. 38\\nIndeed, it is clear that for all the extraneous discussion of Sosna and Franks, the decision today follows those cases, for it recognizes that an Art. III \"case or controversy\" persists in this instance notwithstanding the apparent mootness of the claims of named plaintiffs, and, therefore, confirms that our jurisdiction is constitutionally viable. Otherwise, of course, the Court could not, as it does today, voluntarily \"decline\" to pass on the merits of the suit, ante, at 134, but rather would be compelled to avoid any such decision. While, as shall be seen, I disagree that the modification of Pennsylvania law warrants even a clarifying remand in this instance, I think it particularly unwise to hide a purely discretionary decision behind the language of Art. III jurisdiction. After all, the action actually taken today by the Court a remand for consideration in light of intervening law is regularly ordered in one or two short paragraphs without such fanfare or gratuitous discussion. See, e. g., Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 430 U.S. 141, 97 S.Ct. 987, 51 L.Ed.2d 224 (1977); cf. Cook v. Hudson, 429 U.S. 165, 97 S.Ct. 543, 50 L.Ed.2d 373 (1976). 39\\nI do not express this objection to the Court\\'s opinion due to a concern for craft alone. Jurisdictional and procedural matters regularly dealt with by the Court often involve complex and esoteric concepts. An opinion that is likely to lead to misapplication of these principles will cost litigants dearly and will needlessly consume the time of lower courts in attempting to decipher and construe our commands. Consequently I have frequently voiced my concern that the recent Art. III jurisprudence of this Court in such areas as mootness and standing is creating an obstacle course of confusing standardless rules to be fathomed by courts and litigants, see, e. g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 519-530, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2215-2221, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S., at 348-350, 94 S.Ct., at 1721-1722 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), without functionally aiding in the clear, adverse presentation of the constitutional questions presented. As written, today\\'s opinion can only further stir up the jurisdictional stew and frustrate the efforts of litigants who legitimately seek access to the courts for guidance on the content of fundamental constitutional rights. 40\\nIn this very case, for example, we deny to the parties and to numerous amici intervenors an authoritative constitutional ruling for a reason that at best has only surface plausibility. In truth, the Court\\'s purported concern for the \"lack of homogeneity\" among the children in the class is meaningless in the context of this appeal. The District Court\\'s judgment established and applied a minimum threshold of due process rights available across the board to all children who are committed to mental facilities by their parents pursuant to Pennsylvania law. The core of the mandated rights, essentially the non-waivable appointment of counsel for every child and the convening of commitment hearings within specified time periods,2 applies equally to all Pennsylvania children who are subject to parental commitment. In reviewing the propriety of these threshold constitutional requirements, our inquiry is not to any meaningful extent affected by the intervening change in Pennsylvania law.3 Indeed, we are informed by Pennsylvania officials that the 1976 amendment, by abolishing parental commitment of mentally ill children over 14, merely serves to eliminate 20% of the members of the certified class from the lawsuit. Reply Brief for Appellants 1. The amendment, however, bears no relationship whatever to the District Court\\'s judgment insofar as it pertains to the remaining 80% of the class that is, to those children who can still be committed by their parents.4 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania itself acknowledges that \"(o)ver three-fourths of the plaintiff class . . . are subject to the very statutes which the lower court examined, declared unconstitutional, and enjoined.\" Id., at 3. The Court\\'s disposition of this case, therefore, ensures nothing but an opportunity for the waste of valuable time and energy. At most, the District Court on remand realistically can be expected to confirm that 20% of the children no longer are members of the class, while reaffirming its carefully considered judgment as to the remaining 80%. I do not understand why we do not spare the District Court this purely mechanical task of paring down the class, for nothing would now prevent us from excluding 20% of the children from our consideration of the merits and evaluating the District Court\\'s judgment as it affects the remaining 80%. See, e. g., Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S., at 755-757, 96 S.Ct., at 1259-1260. 41\\nNor can the Court\\'s action be justified by its order to the District Court that new class representatives with live claims be substituted to press forward with the suit. For, again, in the posture of this case, this is purely a matter of form. Franks, Sosna, and Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110-111, n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 854, 861, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975), plainly recognize and act upon the premise that, given the representative nature of class actions,5 the elimination of named plaintiffs ordinarily will have no effect on the \"concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the Court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions\". Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). Certainly, in this appeal there can be no question of adequate adversity and cogency of argument. Attorneys for the class continue diligently to defend their judgment in behalf of the children who are still within the purview of Pennsylvania\\'s parental commitment law. Pennsylvania equally diligently resists the District Court\\'s judgment and pressures for a controlling constitutional decision. And a vast assortment of amici curiae ranging from sister States to virtually all relevant professional organizations have submitted briefs informing our deliberations from every perspective and orientation plausibly relevant to the case. In brief, the Court\\'s assertion of its inability \"to make informed resolution of\" the issues is, in this instance, pure fancy. 42\\nI do not believe that we discharge our institutional duty fairly, or properly service the constituencies who depend on our guidance, by issuing meaningless remands that play wasteful games with litigants and lower courts.6 Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the Court\\'s disposition of this case. Because the Court does not address the important constitutional questions presented, I too shall defer the expression of my views, pending the Court\\'s inevitable review of those questions in a later case. 1 Haverford State Hospital was initially named as a defendant but was dismissed by mutual agreement. 402 F.Supp. 1039, 1043 n. 6 (ED Pa.1975). 2 The principal distinction between the sections is that a voluntary commitment is not to exceed 30 days, with successive periods not to exceed 30 days each, as long as care or observation is necessary. There is no time limitation following a voluntary admission to a facility. See id., at 1054-1055, n. 3 (dissenting opinion). See also n. 4, infra. There has been no distinction between the two sections for purposes of this lawsuit. Hence, unless otherwise indicated, we shall use the words \"admitted\" and \"committed\" interchangeably. 3 The statutes provide: 402. \"Voluntary admission; application, examination and acceptance; duration of admission\\n\"(a) Application for voluntary admission to a facility for examination, treatment and care may be made by:\\n\"(1) Any person over eighteen years of age.\\n\"(2) A parent, guardian or individual standing in loco parentis to the person to be admitted, if such person is eighteen years of age or younger.\\n\"(b) When an application is made, the director of the facility shall cause an examination to be made. If it is determined that the person named in the application is in need of care or observation, he may be admitted.\\n\"(c) Except where application for admission has been made under the provisions of section 402(a)(2) and the person admitted is still eighteen years of age or younger, any person voluntarily admitted shall be free to withdraw at any time. Where application has been made under the provisions of section 402(a)(2), only the applicant or his successor shall be free to withdraw the admitted person so long as the admitted person is eighteen years of age or younger.\\n\"(d) Each admission under the provisions of this section shall be reviewed at least annually by a committee, appointed by the director from the professional staff of the facility wherein the person is admitted, to determine whether continued care is necessary. Said committee shall make written recommendations to the director which shall be filed at the facility and be open to inspection and review by the department and such other persons as the secretary by regulation may permit.\\n\"Where the admission is under the provisions of section 402(a)(2), the person admitted shall be informed at least each sixty days of the voluntary nature of his status at the facility.\" Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 50, 4402 (1969) (footnote omitted). 403. \"Voluntary commitment; application, examination and acceptance; duration of commitment\\n\"(a) Application for voluntary commitment to a facility for examination, treatment and care may be made by:\\n\"(1) Any person over eighteen years of age.\\n\"(2) A parent, guardian or individual standing in loco parentis to the person to be admitted, if such person is eighteen years of age or younger.\\n\"(b) The application shall be in writing, signed by the applicant in the presence of at least one witness. When an application is made, the director of the facility shall cause an examination to be made. If it is determined that the person named in the application is in need of care or observation, he shall be committed for a period not to exceed thirty days. Successive applications for continued voluntary commitment may be made for successive periods not to exceed thirty days each, so long as care or observation is necessary.\\n\"(c) No person voluntarily committed shall be detained for more than ten days after he has given written notice to the director of his intention or desire to leave the facility, or after the applicant or his successor has given written notice of intention or desire to remove the detained person.\\n\"(d) Each commitment under the provisions of this section shall be reviewed at least annually by a committee, appointed by the director from the professional staff of the facility wherein the person is cared for, to determine whether continued care and commitment is necessary. Said committee shall make written recommendations to the director which shall be filed at the facility and be open to inspection and review by the department and such other persons as the secretary by regulation shall permit.\\n\"Where the commitment is under the provisions of section 403(a)(2), the person committed shall be informed at least each sixty days of the voluntary nature of his status at the facility.\" Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 50, 4403 (1969) (footnote omitted). 4 With respect to those voluntarily admitted, the 1966 Act explicitly distinguishes between adults, who are free to withdraw at any time, and those 18 and younger, who may withdraw only with the consent of the admitting parent or guardian. 402(c). However, 403(c), relating to withdrawal after voluntary commitment, does not explicitly make an age distinction, and, on its face, would allow either the person committed or the applicant (i. e., the parent or guardian) to effect the withdrawal. However, neither the court below nor the parties below have read the statute as containing this distinction. E. g., Brief for Appellants 25. 5 201(2) of the 1966 Act. 6 Relevant portions of the regulations are set forth in the District Court\\'s opinion. 402 F.Supp., at 1042-1043, n. 5. 7 Section 406 is the statute that provides for the hearing procedures to be used in an involuntary civil court commitment. Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 50, 4406 (1969). 8 Section 201 provides:\\n\"Any person 14 years of age or over who believes that he is in need of treatment and substantially understands the nature of voluntary commitment may submit himself to examination and treatment under this act, provided that the decision to do so is made voluntarily. A parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis to a child less than 14 years of age may subject such child to examination and treatment under this act, and in so doing shall be deemed to be acting for the child. Except as otherwise authorized in this act, all of the provisions of this act governing examination and treatment shall apply.\" 9 Section 206 provides:\\n\"(a) A person in voluntary inpatient treatment may withdraw at any time by giving written notice unless, as stated in section 203, he has agreed in writing at the time of his admission that his release can be delayed following such notice for a period to be specified in the agreement, provided that such period shall not exceed 72 hours.\\n\"(b) If the person is under the age of 14, his parent, legal guardian, or person standing in loco parentis may effect his release. If any responsible party believes that it would be in the best interest of a person under 14 years of age in voluntary treatment to be withdrawn therefrom or afforded treatment constituting a less restrictive alternative, such party may file a petition in the Juvenile Division of the court of common pleas for the county in which the person under 14 years of age resides, requesting a withdrawal from or modification of treatment. The court shall promptly appoint an attorney for such minor person and schedule a hearing to determine what inpatient treatment, if any, is in the minor\\'s best interest. The hearing shall be held within ten days of receipt of the petition, unless continued upon the request of the attorney for such minor. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules governing other Juvenile Court proceedings.\\n\"(c) Nothing in this act shall be construed to require a facility to continue inpatient treatment where the director of the facility determines such treatment is not medically indicated. Any dispute between a facility and a county administrator as to the medical necessity for voluntary inpatient treatment of a person shall be decided by the Commissioner of Mental Health or his designate.\" (Footnote omitted.) 10 The following notations are found in various medical records and evaluations in the record: (a) appellee Bartley, \"Admission Note: Organic Brain Syndrome with epilepsy\" (App. 137a); (b) appellee Gentile, \"Schizophrenia\" (id., at 145a); appellee Levine, \"functioning within the average range of intelligence\" (id., at 167a); appellee Weand, \"dull normal range of intelligence\" (id., at 169a); appellee Mathews, \"functioning on a lower average range of intelligence, giving evidence of bright, normal and even superior learning capacities\" (id., at 175a). 11 Given our view that the Act moots the claims of the named appellees, we need not address the issue of whether the promulgation of the new regulations had previously mooted their claims. 12 Mr. Justice BRENNAN suggests that none of this is relevant to our adjudication of the case. Post, at 140-142. Implicit in this suggestion is the conclusion that in the present posture of this case certification of a class represented by these named plaintiffs would be acceptable. This approach disregards the prerequisites to class actions contained in Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(a), see n. 14, infra, and pushed to its logical conclusions would do away with the standing requirement of Art. III. See, e. g., Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 33, 82 S.Ct. 549, 550, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962) (parties may not \"represent a class of whom they are not a part\"); Schlesinger v. Reservists to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 216, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 2930, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974) (class representative must \"possess the same interest and suffer the same injury\" as members of class). 13 Mr. Justice BRENNAN, post, at 142, seeks to minimize the extent of the changes in the law by asserting that only 20% of the plaintiff class is affected by the new Act. Even if this assertion were undisputed, it would not affect our disposition of the case. But we have no way to test the reliability of that figure. Before the new Act was passed, the distinction between mentally ill and mentally retarded was largely irrelevant for admissions purposes; hence the District Court made no findings with respect to the proportion of the class in each category, and the dissent does not indicate any support in the record for this figure, which first appears in the Reply Brief for Appellants 1 n. 2. Since this information was supplied by a party seeking a determination on the merits, it cannot be treated as a form of \"admission against interest\" by a litigant on appeal. In addition, the suggestion that 80% of the class remains in status quo ante completely overlooks the substantial changes wrought by the regulations, which classified on the basis of age, rather than on the basis of mental illness or mental retardation. 14 Rule 23(a) provides:\\n\"(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" 15 Mr. Justice BRENNAN suggests that our refusal to review the merits of these claims, and our vacation of the District Court\\'s judgment, are simply a confusing and unnecessary exaltation of form over substance. While our refusal to pass on the merits rests on discretionary considerations, we have long heeded such discretionary counsel in constitutional litigation. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 341, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The dissent\\'s startling statement that our insistence on plaintiffs with live claims is \"purely a matter of form,\" post, at 142, would read into the Constitution a vastly expanded version of Rule 23 while reading Art. III out of the Constitution. The availability of thoroughly prepared attorneys to argue both sides of a constitutional question, and of numerous amici curiae ready to assist in the decisional process, even though all of them \"stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start,\" does not dispense with the requirement that there be a live dispute between \"live\" parties before we decide such a question.\\nThe dissent, post, at 137, attaches great weight to the fact that the State argues that the case is not moot. As we have pointed out in the text, infra, at 136, the fact that the parties desire a decision on the merits does not automatically entitle them to receive such a decision. It is not at all unusual for all parties in a case to desire an adjudication on the merits when the alternative is additional litigation; but their desires can be scarcely thought to dictate the result of our inquiry into whether the merits should be reached. The dissent\\'s additional reliance on the \"numerous amici (who have requested) an authoritative constitutional ruling . . .\" post, at 140, overlooks the fact that briefs for no fewer than eight of these amici argue that the case is moot or suggest that the case be remanded for consideration of the intervening legislation. 16 Upon promulgation of the regulations, the named appellees received, inter alia, the right to institute a \"section 406\" involuntary commitment proceeding in court within two business days. Under 406, a judicial hearing is held after notice to the parties; counsel is provided for indigents. It is this right to a hearing that was the gravamen of appellees\\' complaint. App. 21a-23a, (complaint P 46). 1 The statutory modification upon which the Court principally relies for mootness pertains solely to mentally ill children 14 or older, whereas the class consists of all children who are mentally ill and retarded. Since this distinction was irrelevant when the action commenced, the complaint does not inform us whether the named class members, while older than 14, are mentally ill or mentally retarded. Thus, it is accurate for the Court to state that \"insofar as the record indicates,\" all the named children are mentally ill and consequently fall within the purview of the 1976 statutory amendment. Ante, at 128. But, since the record barely scratches the surface in this regard, it is possible that some of the children have been committed because of retardation. If so, the Court\\'s supposition that the claims of the named parties are mooted is inaccurate and presumably can be corrected by the District Court on remand. 2 In brief, the District Court mandated a probable-cause hearing within 72 hours of the initial detention followed by a complete postcommitment hearing within two weeks thereafter. 402 F.Supp. 1039, 1049 (ED Pa.1975). 3 The September 1, 1973, regulations, on which the Court additionally places some reliance, are even less relevant to the proper disposition of this case. Under these regulations, the procedural rights of juveniles 13 or older underwent change following commencement of this suit. These older juveniles now must be informed of their rights within 24 hours of commitment and must be given the telephone number of an attorney. Should the retarded or mentally ill child be capable and willing to take the initiative, he may object to this commitment, contact his lawyer, and request a hearing. The hospital then can file an involuntary commitment petition, whereby the child remains in the institution pending the hearing on his commitment; the regulations fix no time period in which this hearing must be held. In its consideration of this case, the District Court was fully aware of these regulations, but concluded that they do not resolve the constitutional infirmities that it found to inhere in Pennsylvania\\'s statutory scheme. Id., at 1042-1043, n. 5. In particular, the regulations fall far short of satisfying the lower court\\'s judgment in its failure to guarantee to every child the nonwaivable guidance of an attorney and a prompt commitment hearing within a specified time period. For this reason, the Court\\'s concern that the class is subdivided into \"a bewildering lineup of permutations and combinations\", ante, at 130, actually is of no constitutional significance to the decision of this suit. For even taking the regulations into account, all the children who can be committed by their parents continue to be held pursuant to procedures as to which plaintiffs complain, and as to which the District Court concluded, constitutional standards are not satisfied. 4 The 1976 Act does provide that, with respect to all children, a \"responsible party\" may step forward and challenge a child\\'s commitment by filing a petition in the juvenile court requesting the appointment of an attorney and the convening of a hearing. Mental Health Procedures Act 206(b) (1976). Given that the most likely \"responsible party,\" the child\\'s parents, are the persons seeking his institutionalization, Pennsylvania itself recognizes that this amounts to \"no real change in the law\" and to no \"additional procedural protections.\" Reply Brief for Appellants 1-2, n. 3. 5 See, e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 194, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976); Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117-118, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2875, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (opinion of Blackmun, J.). 6 On several occasions, the Court complains that my position, in characterizing today\\'s action as meaningless and wasteful, fails to give due consideration to the requirements of Art. III and Rule 23. Ante, at 131, n. 12, 134 n. 15. This contention is seriously misleading. When the class was duly certified in 1974, both Rule 23 and Art. III were properly complied with as I agree they must be. The Rule 23 issue is no longer before us, for we cannot, some three years later, sua sponte and over the objection of all parties, challenge compliance with a Rule of Civil Procedure, unless, of course, noncompliance or some intervening circumstance serves to undercut our jurisdiction. That is not the case here, however, for both the majority and I are in agreement that no jurisdictional defect is to be found. In sum, therefore, the inquiry applicable to this case is the following: Does this Court properly exercise its discretion through its remand to the District Court when (1) our Art. III jurisdiction is sound, and (2) the class plaintiff was properly certified pursuant to Federal Rule, and (3) no party objected or today objects to the certification, and (4) the class continues to possess live claims and a District Court judgment that are unaffected by any constitutionally relevant changes in state law, and (5) the substance of the constitutional contentions continue to be litigated cogently by both parties? When these factors are fairly taken into account, the conclusion is plain that today\\'s action can be justified neither by the quasi-jurisdictional language which the Court needlessly includes in its opinion, nor by sound, practical considerations of discretion.

This period witnessed the radical reconstruction of notions of race and gender, the formation of national issue-oriented political parties, the evolution of a powerful industrial-capitalist economy, and the emergence of the U.S. as a key player in international affairs. More importantly, the age saw a deliberate and on-going effort by Americans to express, support, and expand notions of democracy, civic virtue, and republicanism for everyone in the United States. This course takes these noble aspirations seriously; asking where and how Americans defined these concepts, whether or not they were met, and how the major social movements both reflected and forced changes on the American people. We will use two original investigations of U.S. social history to examine these changes in detail. Our mission is to become familiar with the key concepts and events in American history, to foster informed in-class discussions of these concepts and events, and to emerge at the end of the quarter with a heightened awareness of, and empathy for the people who created this country. The basic tools that we will use to meet these objectives are formal lectures, class discussions, outside reading, slide and video presentations, humor, and most importantly our intellectual curiosity. While the class is not intended as a civics lesson, it will stress the fact that deciphering the meaning of history is an ongoing intellectual process -- one that will continue with or without your active participation. The class can act as a starting point for your role in this debate. As a result of these efforts, this class will be working to build what Briar Cliff College calls our \"historical foundation.\" As defined by the College, \"the Historical Foundation promotes a habit of mind which examines \\'events\\' within historical context, both as a way of discerning truth as well as appreciating the development and continuity of the human community.\" REQUIRED BOOKS John Mack Faragher, et. al., Out of Many: A History of the American People.

KEY DATES AND GRADING STRUCTURE Exam #1, December 20 (20%) A = 90-100 Blanke Paper, January 3 (15%) B = 80- 89 Exam #2, January 24 (20%) C= 70-79 In-Class Presentations, February 7-9 (15%) D = 60-69 Final Exam, Thursday, February 22 (20%) In-Class Participation, Quizzes, Professional/Adult Behavior, etc. (10%) DESCRIPTION OF GRADED EVENTS Exams (60%) will each be divided into three sections. The first asks you to identify the significance of several key terms and is worth 40% of the exam. The second asks for one short answer to a question and is worth 30% of the exam. The third asks for a well-argued essay answer and is worth 30% of the exam. The Final Exam will not be comprehensive. Handouts will be made available listing probable ID terms for each exam. A brief, in-class review of the format for the first exam is possible if needed. See the history department web-page for more \"useful information.\" The In-Class Presentation (15%) will be a 10 minute, in-class presentation by teams of 4-6 students on historical topics and in formats defined by the groups. A handout describing the parameters of this assignment and a posting of the assigned teams will be made available by the third week of class. Attendance will be taken and is mandatory for all presentation days. Individual students will have their own grade dropped 5% for failing to attend either class period. Blanke Paper (15%) is a four- to six-page analytical review of a secondary work in history. A style sheet will be distributed to provide additional information on this assignment. In-Class Participation, Quizzes, Professional/Adult Behavior (10%) will be held in-class and will deal with the material presented in the textbook and discussed in class. In addition, I will reward those who attend class regularly, use the time in class professionally (i.e., no sleeping, excessive talking, etc.). This is a significant component of the final grade and should be treated as such. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY, ATTENDANCE, AND OTHER CLASS POLICIES It is my experience and belief that most students attend class regularly, submit assignments and take exams on time, perform well over the quarter, and do not cheat. Moreover, I am flexible with students who prove willing to work to overcome early-quarter \"lapses\" in attendance, performance, or honesty. Unfortunately, the following rules are necessary for those unable or unwilling to meet the basic requirements of College life. The penalty for academic dishonesty is specified in the current Undergraduate Bulletin. In short, students will be awarded zero points for any assignment in which cheating is detected. Moreover, the student\\'s academic advisor will be informed of any instances of cheating. Regular attendance is vital to all College course work. I reserve the right to lower your final grade if you miss class for any reason more than three times over the course of the quarter. If you miss six or more classes I will expect you to drop the class or accept a failing grade for the course. Students who fail the first exam are required to schedule a meeting with me within one week of the return of the exam to discuss their work and ways to improve their performance. Make-up exams will be offered to students who call me before test time and later provide a written notice of an excused absence. The questions on the make-up exam will not be harder, per se, but the exam will not offer optional questions (e.g., on a scheduled exam the student will be asked to answer one of two essay questions, on a make-up exam there will be only one question). Make-up exams will be offered for only one week after the scheduled date of the exam, after which the student will earn a score of zero for that assignment. A student may only take one make-up exam over the span of the quarter. See me immediately if the material, course description, or assignments are confusing in any way. In addition, see me immediately if you have any special physical needs or need any unique arrangements in order to attend and successfully complete the course. FINAL THOUGHTS AND MISCELLANEOUS \"RAH-RAH\" Throw out your previous bad experiences with History in High School or at other Colleges. This course does not require that you memorize speeches, dates, or statistics that (as College students) your are intelligent enough to look up in any textbook. The focus in this course is on finding the significance of people, events, and ideas. While those habitually \"bored\" with history may be able to convince themselves that this class is no different than others, we will be approaching the past in ways that constantly require our conscious (re)consideration. History as a discipline requires no special knowledge, has little or no technical jargon, and ultimately is the study of what makes people do what they do. There is nothing in this class (or other history classes) that is too difficult to comprehend if you are willing to read the assignments, attend class, take notes, and use your God-given intellect. Use the web-site. It is intended to help and, according to those who have taken this class in the past, it does help. It is my job to present the material as clearly and as engaging as possible. It is my job to be available to you to help you to experience the intellectual exhilaration of the \"historical foundation.\" In sum, I am here to help you with a subject that I love to talk about. While I can\\'t guarantee that every student will find equal joy in the academic challenge of the course, I can promise that I will bring my excitement and the best of my abilities to class every day.

A., Economics: A Contemporary Introduction, 6th Edition, South-western, 2002. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose of this course is to develop a basic understanding of the major concepts, theories, and tools used in analyzing the economic behavior of consumers and firms in a market economy. Among the subjects included are demand and supply model, elasticity, minimum wage and labor market, cost and production, pricing under different market structures, government regulations, and global trade. ASSIGNMENTS:\\nAssignments include reading the text, completing the assigned problem sets, and the Internet Assignments. The Internet Assignments provide students with the opportunity to use the World Wide Web as a research tool to perform economic analysis. These assignments allow the students to learn by taking advantage of new technology and to experience the link between the real world and economic theory. Lectures will cover the material indicated in the Required Readings list. Topics may be added and/or deleted depending upon time and other considerations during the semester. It may also be necessary to change the order of topics. Changes of this nature will be announced in class. There will be two types of problem sets: (a) Handout problems. The purpose of these problems is to prepare the students for detailed discussions of the material covered in the class. Collaboration on doing these problems is highly encouraged. These problems are not to be handed in for grades. (b) Problems from the text. These problems should be completed and handed in by the due dates. Each set will be graded. No late homework will be accepted. The assignment set with the lowest score (or one missed assignment) will be dropped in computing your overall homework grade. GRADING: The course grade will be based on class participation, homework, quizzes, best 2 out of 3 midterms, and one comprehensive final exam. Exams are closed book and closed notes. Make-up exams will be given for missed exams only when duly excused (my prior permission is required). A 5- percent extra credit will be awarded at the discretion of the instructor on the basis of class attendance, participation, and timely return of the assignments. To qualify student should have perfect attendance record, no delays in turning in their assignments, and turning in a quality work.

That\\'s A Good Idea. | Main | Weekend Journal September 07, 2007 The Fall Classes The semester began yesterday. I\\'m teaching \"Introduction to Political Theory\" and \"Media and Politics\".\\nThis is the first time for Political Theory and I\\'m quite excited about it. I have a packed classroom with lots of students from last semester. The class fulfills a college requirement, so I have some biology and nursing students, along with a lot of political science majors. I have to find some middle road between them. We\\'re using a reader, which takes the best bits of Plato and Hobbes. Next Monday we\\'re going to start off slow. Just some Greek and Roman history and Pericles\\' Funeral oration. Theory is the sort of class that can be dreadfully slow or great. It really depends on the students doing the readings. I hope they do the readings. I hope.\\nThe second is class is a repeat, but I\\'m blowing up the syllabus from last semester and starting over. Last semester, I tried to do several weeks just on New Media. But the readings were of questionable quality. Everything before 2006 is dated. Last semester, I had the students create a blog. It could be on any topic. They had to write 20 posts with links to other online sources. But it was too difficult to grade blogs on different topics, and students had to quickly learn about another topic that wasn\\'t related to the class. This time, all blogs will be on the topic of media, and I will assign them very specific topics for their posts. Example, \"Describe and respond to one op-ed article in a mainstream paper. Or evaluate and compare two blogs.\"\\nI\\'m very excited about the coming semester.

Do they use commercial blog services (ie--blogger, wordpress, etc.) or does the school have some kind of intranet-hosted blogs?

Course Evaluations: Near the conclusion of each semester, students in the College of Education Electronically evaluate courses taken within the COE. Evaluation data is used for a variety of important purposes including: 1. Course and program improvement, planning and accreditation; 2. Instruction evaluation purposes; and 3. making decisions on faculty tenure, promotion, pay, and retention. As you evaluate this course, please be thoughtful, thorough, and accurate in completing the evaluation. Please know that the COE faculty is committed to excellence in teaching and continued improvement. Therefore your response is critical! In the College of Education, the course evaluation process has been simplified and is completed electronically through MySFA. Although the instructor will be able to view the names of students who complete the survey, all rating and comments are confidential and anonymous, and will not be available to the instructor until after final grades are posted. 5 EXTRA CREDIT points will be added to your total points before your grade is averaged if you complete a course evaluation BEFORE the university deadline. VIII. Student Ethics and Other Policy Information: Attendance: Attendance in class is required. You will be responsible for signing the attendance sheet during each class period. The attendance sheet will be taken up at the beginning of each class. If you are late, it is your responsibility to come to the instructor (after class) and ask for the attendance sheet to sign. If you do not sign in, you will be considered absent. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to obtain handouts and class notes from your peers. Absence is not an excuse for missing information, handouts, class notes, etc. If you miss class during an exam or other assignment that a grade was given, you are responsible for providing written documentation (illness, hospitalization, death in the family) so that you may make up that grade. You are responsible for scheduling the make-up within one week of the missed class. Your final grade will be lowered by 5 points for every three unexcused absences. Excused absences must have documentation (i.e. documented illness from a physician, etc.) which must be submitted within one week of absence. Students with Disabilities: To obtain disability related accommodations, alternate formats and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS), Human Services Building, and Room 325, 468-3004/468-1004 (TDD) as early as possible in the semester. Once verified, ODS will notify the course instructor and outline the accommodation and/or auxiliary aids to be provided. Failure to request services in a timely manner may delay your accommodations.

Academic Integrity: Academic Integrity is a responsibility of all university faculty and students. Faculty members promote academic integrity in multiple ways including instruction on the components of academic honesty, as well as abiding by university policy on penalties for cheating and plagiarism. Definition of Academic Dishonesty: Academic Dishonesty includes both cheating and plagiarism. Cheating includes but is not limited to (1) using or attempting to use unauthorized materials to aid in achieving a better grade on a component of a class; (2) the falsification of invention of any information, including citations, on an assigned exercise; and or (3) helping or attempting to help another in an act of cheating or plagiarism. Plagiarism is presenting the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own. Examples of plagiarism are (1) submitting an assignment as if it were ones own work that has been purchased or otherwise obtained from an Internet source or another source; and (3) incorporating the words or ideas of an author into ones paper without giving the author due credit. Please read the complete policy at http://www.sfasu.edu/policies/academic_integrity.asp Withheld Grades Semester Grades Policy (A-54): Ordinarily at the discretion of the instructor of record and with the approval of the academic chair/director, a grade of WH will be assigned only if the student cannot complete the course work because of unavoidable circumstances. Students must complete the work within one calendar year from the end of the semester in which they receive a WH, or the grade automatically becones an F. If students register for the same course in future terms the WH will automatically become an F and will be counted as a repeated course for the purpose of computing the grade point average. Acceptable Student Behavior: Classroom behavior should not interfere with the instructors ability to conduct the class or the ability of other students to learn from the instructional program (see the Student Conduct Code, policy D-34.1). Unacceptable or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Students who disrupt the learning environment may be asked to leave class and may be subject to judicial, academic or other penalties. This prohibition applies to all instructional forums, including electronic, classroom, labs, discussion groups, field trips, etc. The instructor shall have full discretion over what behavior is appropriate/inappropriate in the classroom. Students who do not attend class regularly or who perform poorly on class projects/exams may be referred to the Early Alert Program. This program provides students with recommendations for resources or other assistance that is available to help SFA students succeed.

Academic Ethics: Every member of the Collin College community is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. Collin College may initiate disciplinary proceedings against a student accused of scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, statements, acts, or omissions related to applications for enrollment or the award of a degree, and/or the submission of ones own work material that is not ones own. Scholastic dishonesty may involve, but is not limited to, one or more of the following acts: cheating, plagiarism, collusion, use of annotated texts or teachers editions, use of information about exams posted on the Internet or electronic medium, and/or falsifying academic records. While specific examples are listed below, this is not an exhaustive list and scholastic dishonesty may encompass other conduct, including any conduct through electronic or computerized means: Plagiarism is the use of an authors words or ideas as if they were ones own without giving credit to the source, including, but not limited to, failure to acknowledge a direct quotation. Cheating is the willful giving or receiving of information in an unauthorized manner during an examination; collaborating with another student during an examination without authority; using, buying, selling, soliciting, stealing, or otherwise obtaining course assignments and/or examination questions in advance, copying computer or Internet files, using someone elses work for assignments as if it were ones own; or any other dishonest means of attempting to fulfill the requirements of a course. Collusion is intentionally or unintentionally aiding or attempting to aid another in an act of scholastic dishonesty, including but not limited to, failing to secure academic work; providing a paper or project to another student; providing an inappropriate level of assistance; communicating answers to a classmate about an examination or any other course assignment; removing tests or answer sheets from a test site, and allowing a classmate to copy answers. See the current Collin Student Handbook for additional information. RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS: In accordance with Section 51.911 of the Texas Education Code, CCCCD will allow a student who is absent from class for the observance of a religious holy day to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time. Students are required to file a written request with EACH PROFESSOR within the FIRST 15 DAYS OF THE SEMESTER to qualify for an excused absence. A copy of the state rules and procedures regarding holy days, and 1302/Grimland- 7 the form of notification of absence from each class under this provision, are available from the Admissions and Records Office. EMERGENCY PROVISION: In case of campus closure due to inclement weather, national or local disaster, or for any other unforeseen reason, students are expected to continue classwork according to the schedule of assignments. When classes resume, we will pick up with the appropriate lesson scheduled for that date unless a test or quiz was scheduled. Tests and quizzes will be made up on the day classes resume, but missing lectures or other scheduled work will be rescheduled into the rest of the semester. Student is ultimately responsible for keeping assignments current during any hiatus. CHECK BLACKBOARD FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM INSTRUCTOR. SICKNESS PROVISION: SAME AS EMERGENCY PROVISION. CHANGES TO SYLLABUS: This syllabus, including the schedule of assignments that follows, may be changed during the semester at the discretion of the instructor to better meet the needs of this course; if so, students will be provided a revised copy or notified in class of the changes. CELL PHONES/PAGERS: During class all electronic devices must be silenced. I DO NOT EVEN WANT TO SEE THEM. If you must answer your phone, you need to consider whether you should be in class that day. First offense: loss of 50% of participation grade; second offense: loss of 50% of participation grade. After that, loss of attendance points. PERSONAL CONDUCT: Your classmates and I expect you to arrive on time and leave when class is dismissed. Additionally, we expect you to come to class prepared and ready to add to our discussions. PERSONAL COMPUTER /STAPLER ISSUES: I expect you to purchase a mini-stapler and to use it for your papers. Furthermore, although I might sympathize with your personal electrical problems, your lack of paper or ink, your recent move, or any other excuse that prevents you from printing your paper before class, you are not excused from turning in your paper no later than 5 minutes after the due date. E-MAIL: Unless I ask you to email an assignment to me, I will not open any attachments from students. Therefore, please use CougarMail to communicate with me about assignments or other matters. Do not use e-mail in BlackBoard. DUE DATES: The dates listed on the attached course schedule reflect the DATES THAT ALL ASSIGNMENTS AND READINGS SHOULD BE COMPLETED. I expect you to consult your syllabus and course schedule regularly. 1302/Grimland- 8 \"]\n",

There is trend away from the mono-chromatic, simple and witty icons of the 19th century and towards a more slick, conceptually vacant and multi-color mark of the 90s internet boom.\\nAssigning a logo assignment in school has always been about a)clarity of message and b)designing within strict limitations. Yes, this is quickly becoming an old-fashion way of looking at a logo, but I truly feel something is being lost. And that, that is being lost is metaphoric of what is being lost in graphic design in general. The 1980s AT&T logo (designed by the amazing Saul Bass) is a classic example of wonderful design. You can imagine the design brief from the client stating that they wanted a mark that communicated that they are a global communications company. If you take away the text the mark still works. It references the global nature of the company by its circular shape and the lines in-force this (latitude lines) and at the same time makes the viewer think about satellites and data. The mechanical nature of the rendering connotes precision and competence.\\nWonderful. A tremendous amount of clarity in a small package. And it works just as well in black and whitewhich means the client can save money on things like bills and invoices where printing in color would cost more money. Plus theyll look great when they send out faxes and when their logo gets photocopied. Boo-ya! Now, take our new logo. Take away the type and what do we have? Okay, now imagine this mark in 5, 10 years when the memory of the old logo is now longer with us. What do we have? In my mind the reality in which this mark is rendered leaves little to the imagination. While I had no problem suspending my perception of scale with the old mark, with this one I am inclined to view it (and that also means interpret it) as a small mark. It looks to me like a rubber ball Id by from a machine at the grocery store for 25 cents. The blue transparency has a lot to do with that perception as well. Rarely do I see perfectly translucent globes in scales larger than a couple inches.\\nSo without the suspension of my perception of scale, this mark connotes playfulness, simple, classic and affordability and at the same time, once Im thinking in these terms I also believe the mark means easily losable, childish, and cheap. The strips do not look mechanically precise anymore. They communicate a random, organic and in-precise manufacturing process. Does this mental frame communicate AT&T? I think not. Does this mark survive a trip through the fax machine or photocopier? This new mark is all style and no thinking. It looses whatever thought went into it in a couple years. Its what design has become. This way of thinking about design is not sustainable. If the internet has taught us anything its once we put the tools to create in the hands of everyone, everyone decides what is acceptable. And anyone can create style; you dont need a fancy design degree for that.\\nNot everyone can create the old AT&T mark. That requires talent, and a fancy design degree can help bring out that talent. Design should be just as much about how something functions, or solves a clients problem as it is about making something visually pleasing. The visually pleasing part is getting way too much attention, and other professions are taking away the making things work part of design. 21 November 2005 12:50 PM , t:systems , t:concepts of design , p:designing So BBEdit 8 has been released and there has been a huge outcry about the icon. Lots of people dislike it. I tend to agree, and Id like to talk about why. Here are the two BBEdit icons. The (A)old and (B)the new. One might think that the simple change in typeface is what makes the new icon bad, but it is far more complicated than that.\\nBefore we can have an opinion about the icon, we need to decide how to evaluate it. Simple gut reactions based on personal preference are useless when trying to have a reasonable discussion. There are 3 criteria that Ill evaluate the icons on: composition, concept and usefulness. To help in the discussion lets also talk about some alternate icons at the same time These are (C)The Clipper System by Gedeon Maheux (Icon Factory), (D)SmoothIcons by Corey Marion (Icon Factory) and (E) Jon Hicks alternate BBEdit icon.\\nComposition\\nComposition is the element that changes the most between icons A through D (Jon Hicks icon (E) is conceptually very different from all the others). Composition is what creates the visual hierarchy, meaning the composition is what helps the viewer understand which elements are important, and which are less so. In all the icons expect for B (BBedit 8.0), there is a strong hierarchy. The viewer is told that the letter B is important, and the background is less important. The hierarchy in all of the successful icons (A,C,D & E) is established with contrast and with some help from color theory. The contrast is best explained by looking at the BBEdit 8.0 icon (B)the icon with poor contrast. The letterform is made up of line widths that do not vary, and are similar in width to the blue box behind it. This creates poor contrast and the letterform starts to blend into the background. You may want to point of that the Clipper icon (C) has similar line weight issuesbut they arent issues. Heres why. Dark colors recede and light colors tend to come forward. The same is true for cool colors (blues, purples and greens), they recede into the background and warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) do the opposite. So while the line weights issues in icon (B) and also present in icon (C), icon (C) compensates by using white against the blue. Concept\\nIf you did not know that BBedit was a text editor geared towards writing computer code, would you understand what the application did by viewing any of these icons? Jon Hicks icon (E) comes closest to being successful in this area. All the others rely on the programs and Bare Bones branding to convey the function of the application. The current BBedit icons (B) (A) convey something other than writing text and code. Looking at these icons we might assume that the application is about quilting, or some sort of mechanical engineering. Icons (C) and (D) are just playing off the original, so we will leave them alone in this discussion, although icon (D) might be seen as a board game. Jon Hicks icon (E) gives the impression of the creation of documents, and the typography, with the smaller second b gives a scientific (or mathematical) feel to the application. The blue background might give the impression of blueprints, and the shiny writing instrument has a very technical feel about it. The icon is fairly close to the mark. It starts with text editing and tries to alter it to speak about the technical nature of the text you are editing.\\nAnother approach (which would yield very different results) would be to start with technical imagery and attempt to alter it with the concept of editing text. Usefulness\\nHere we need to consider the environment that an icon lives in. Icons live in a community of other icons (whether they are in the Dock or in the Finder). It is because of this that an icon needs to differentiate itself from other icons, and at the same time seem like it is part of the icon community on your computer. Both goals oppose themselves to some degree.\\nIcons (A) and (B) do not play well in the Mac OS X icon community. They do not follow the aesthetic of the other icons on the machine. This works to their benefitthey differentiate themselves nicely. Icons (C) and (D) are special cases. They are intended to be used with other custom icons. When used as intended, they are very successful.\\nSince Jons icon (E) is based off an Apple icon (TextEdit) is plays very well in the icon community, but may not differentiate itself as well as the other icons.\\nConclusion\\nSo which icon is the best? Well that depends. Personally I am using (D) because the strong black outline allows it to differentiate itself at small sizes, and I am less concerned about the harmony of my icon collection. The idealist in me likes Jon Hicks (E) because it is the strongest conceptually.\\nUltimately the concept of best when it comes to this item of design is a personal choice. My hope in writing this essay was to get people to think about design, and give them a framework to think about it in.\\nI often have problems explaining to non-designers what going through a design program is like. This essay is very much what one of my classes might be like, except I would reach all the points by asking the students questions (sometimes leading them). I am usually very surprised by what they say, and sometimes they even change my mind. 3 September 2004 04:07 PM , t:usability , t:systems , t:looking sideways , t:concepts of design , p:designing In the current issue of Eye Magazine, there is an abridged version of Kevin Larsons paper on the science of word recognition. (Eye Magazine 52, page 74)\\nThe online edition does not have a copy of the article.\\nIts a great read for a typography freak like myself. It basically debunks the word shape theory of reading and supplants it with parallel letter theory. (Which I do not completely comprehend right nowotherwise Id summarize) I cant seemed to find a copy of the full paper online, but hopefully Ill be able to get a copy next time Im at the school library. 22 July 2004 03:22 PM , p:designing , t:concepts of design , t:pratt , t:usability The worlds flags given letter grades 29 March 2004 11:29 AM , t:concepts of design , p:designing , t:fun Top Ten Things They Never Taught Me in Design School 24 March 2004 09:58 AM , p:designing , t:concepts of design Here are a bunch of loosely related notes and thoughts from the Summit. Im plopping them down here because Im insanely busy and will forget to solidify these thoughts if I dont give them a tangible place to live. For me the theme of this years summit: context, methods.\\nForeign phrase I heard most often: contextual inquiry. Being on the IA design methods panels got me to think alot about design patterns and methods in general. I think I tend to practice process methods far more often than form methods. Let me explain. A week or two ago I decided not to teach graphic design anymore. I am really interested in teaching designers to design and not just decorate. This means they need to learn to be able to think and let the solution come from an examination of the problem. I encounter a tremendous amount of resistance when I try to do this from the students. They are far more receptive to thinking this way in my IA and Visual Communications classes. So Im going to focus on teaching those classes better.\\nA good friend and fellow professor was disappointed with my decision. She was saying (essentially) that I was one of the few graphic design professors that didnt teach the students patterns for design. This means I didnt assign a magazine spread and then expect the students to design something that looks like a magazine spread. Instead I wanted the student to read the content of the magazine article and think about how they could best serve the content and contribute to it visually. I think this serves as an example of a positive and as a negative design pattern. The negative pattern is the one that dictates the visual elements that when assembled say magazine spread (that would be the information shape of the magazine)and the process of blindly following the pattern to create something that looks correct.\\nThe positive pattern would be evaluating the actual communications problems and using the information shape of the magazine pattern as a guideline to try to solve the problem.\\nTheres a strong idea here, and like strong ideas Im most certainly not the first one to have it. It needs some editing and further reflection. Typography is both a craft and an art form. Information Architecture is both a craft and an art form. What can IA learn from 500 years of typographic knowledge? There are no new ideas. Most of my personal work habits (ahem, methods?) were validated in the personas and ...and then a miracle occurs sessions. Both essentially talked about ways I tend to think about problems. Peters examples could have been torn right out of my sketchbook for the last ten years. And here I thought I was special. I dont think in complete sentences. What makes the most sense to me is sentence fragments (thoughts) in spacial relationships. I think best by drawing and my laptop was useless as a note taking device. I need to read Andrew Dillons information shape research paper. 1 March 2004 10:05 AM , t:concepts of design , p:designing From a users perspective, opentype on Adobes latest applications is typography done better than it has ever been done on a Macintosh.\\nOver the last week Ive been working on a print piece that is dependent on type. Ive been setting the type with Adobe Garamond and while the new opentype face does not give me anything I didnt have before with the former type 1 family, the user interface to all the options and variations for this face in the opentype version is a huge improvement. Now with opentype, all the alternate glyphs, ligatures (notice the fi combination in the screen shot), and typographic goodness are all contained within one font. Previously in order to get alternate letter forms you would need to use a whole other font for a single letter. Making words bold or italic would destroy these alternate letterforms. To get ligatures you would need to use an option key combination, or sometimes a different fonteither option would reek havoc with spell checkers. The only item concerning opentype that Im confused about is how Adobe is handling optical adjustments. (If a font is optically adjusted, then the letterform changes based on the size it is being used. A standard feature of most type all the way up until about 40 years ago when the industry started using film type, and now digital type). In the fonts that support optical adjustments, we are still given different font files for the different size ranges of type that the face is suppose to be used for. Why cant this be done automatically, and contained within the opentype file? Here is a passage from Adobe on optical adjustments that ships with their typefaces.\\nTypefaces with optical size variants have had their designs subtly adjusted for use at specific point size ranges. This capability reintroduces one of the features of hand-cut metal type, which uses a separate font for each point size and is often optically adjusted. This is an advantage over the current common practice of scaling a single digital type design to different point sizes, which may reduce legibility at smaller sizes or sacrifice subtlety at larger sizes.\\nThe objective of optical sizing is to maintain the integrity and legibility of the underlying typeface design throughout a range of point sizes. The adjustments typically made to the design to optimize it for different sizes are: for larger point sizes, the space between characters (letter fit) tightens, the space within characters (counterforms) closes up (i.e., the letters are slightly more condensed), the serifs become finer and the stroke contrast becomes greater, the overall weight becomes lighter, and the x-height gradually diminishes; for smaller point sizes, opposite adjustments are made.\\nSmaller optical sizes are also useful when output resolution is very limited, such as for on-screen display. One might choose to use a smaller optical size design for creating text on buttons for a Web page, for example.\\nIn other words, no matter how much your intuition tells you the opposite, designs intended for one scale, rarely work as well as they could at a large or smaller scale. 24 January 2004 12:22 PM , t:concepts of design , p:designing , t:tools The current issue of The New York Times Magazine is their annual design issue.

Are you telling me that you think design is all about brain washing the masses and greasing the slimy wheels of capitalism?\\n(Many heads in the room nod yes)\\nMe: Why are you people design majors?\\n(Silence, awkwardness, staring at shoes)\\nStudent A: Well, isnt that what its all about?\\nMe: No! Well, sometimes yes. But you can use your design powers for good or evil. The choice is yours.

He and I came to many of the same conclusions, but he took a different path than I. I found it to be an interesting (and informative) read.\\nHe also has this wonderful line in the book about using websites as projects for design students:\\nTime spent [trying to gain the production skills needed to complete a website] can crowd out the time spent understanding [the] principals [involved] ... Websites are complicated and students have relatively little experience with them, compared to books or television. Introducing students to [information architecture] by asking them to design a commercial website, is like teaching people to swim by pushing them out of a boat in the middle of a lake. The students may learn, but the process cant reasonably be called teaching.\\nNice. 26 September 2003 07:46 PM , t:concepts of design , p:teaching People often ask me about what design books I recommend.

Course Syllabus Page 3 Student Conduct & Discipline The University of Texas System and The University of Texas at Dallas have rules and regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business. It is the responsibility of each student and each student organization to be knowledgeable about the rules and regulations which govern student conduct and activities. General information on student conduct and discipline is contained in the UTD publication, A to Z Guide, which is provided to all registered students each academic year. The University of Texas at Dallas administers student discipline within the procedures of recognized and established due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Rules and Regulations, Series 50000, Board of Regents, The University of Texas System, and in Title V, Rules on Student Services and Activities of the universitys Handbook of Operating Procedures. Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of the Dean of Students, where staff members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations (SU 1.602, 972/883-6391). A student at the university neither loses the rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. He or she is expected to obey federal, state, and local laws as well as the Regents Rules, university regulations, and administrative rules. Students are subject to discipline for violating the standards of conduct whether such conduct takes place on or off campus, or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct. Academic Integrity The faculty expects from its students a high level of responsibility and academic honesty. Because the value of an academic degree depends upon the absolute integrity of the work done by the student for that degree, it is imperative that a student demonstrate a high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, statements, acts or omissions related to applications for enrollment or the award of a degree, and/or the submission as ones own work or material that is not ones own. As a general rule, scholastic dishonesty involves one of the following acts: cheating, plagiarism, collusion and/or falsifying academic records. Students suspected of academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary proceedings. Plagiarism, especially from the web, from portions of papers for other classes, and from any other source is unacceptable and will be dealt with under the universitys policy on plagiarism (see general catalog for details). This course will use the resources of turnitin.com, which searches the web for possible plagiarism and is over 90% effective. Email Use The University of Texas at Dallas recognizes the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. The university encourages all official student email correspondence be sent only to a students U.T. Dallas email address and that faculty and staff consider email from students official only if it originates from a UTD student account. This allows the university to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of all individual corresponding and the security of the transmitted information. UTD furnishes each student with a free email account that is to be used in all communication with university personnel. The Department of Information Resources at U.T. Dallas provides a method for students to have their U.T. Dallas mail forwarded to other accounts. Course Syllabus Page 4 Withdrawal from Class The administration of this institution has set deadlines for withdrawal of any college-level courses. These dates and times are published in that semester\\'s course catalog. Administration procedures must be followed. It is the student\\'s responsibility to handle withdrawal requirements from any class. In other words, I cannot drop or withdraw any student. You must do the proper paperwork to ensure that you will not receive a final grade of \"F\" in a course if you choose not to attend the class once you are enrolled. Student Grievance Procedures Procedures for student grievances are found in Title V, Rules on Student Services and Activities, of the universitys Handbook of Operating Procedures. In attempting to resolve any student grievance regarding grades, evaluations, or other fulfillments of academic responsibility, it is the obligation of the student first to make a serious effort to resolve the matter with the instructor, supervisor, administrator, or committee with whom the grievance originates (hereafter called the respondent). Individual faculty members retain primary responsibility for assigning grades and evaluations. If the matter cannot be resolved at that level, the grievance must be submitted in writing to the respondent with a copy of the respondents School Dean. If the matter is not resolved by the written response provided by the respondent, the student may submit a written appeal to the School Dean. If the grievance is not resolved by the School Deans decision, the student may make a written appeal to the Dean of Graduate or Undergraduate Education, and the deal will appoint and convene an Academic Appeals Panel. The decision of the Academic Appeals Panel is final. The results of the academic appeals process will be distributed to all involved parties. Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of the Dean of Students, where staff members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations. Incomplete Grade Policy As per university policy, incomplete grades will be granted only for work unavoidably missed at the semesters end and only if 70% of the course work has been completed. An incomplete grade must be resolved within eight (8) weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. If the required work to complete the course and to remove the incomplete grade is not submitted by the specified deadline, the incomplete grade is changed automatically to a grade of F. Disability Services The goal of Disability Services is to provide students with disabilities educational opportunities equal to those of their non-disabled peers. Disability Services is located in room 1.610 in the Student Union. Office hours are Monday and Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday, 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; and Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The contact information for the Office of Disability Services is: The University of Texas at Dallas, SU 22 PO Box 830688 Richardson, Texas 75083-0688 (972) 883-2098 (voice or TTY) Course Syllabus Page 5 Essentially, the law requires that colleges and universities make those reasonable adjustments necessary to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability. For example, it may be necessary to remove classroom prohibitions against tape recorders or animals (in the case of dog guides) for students who are blind. Occasionally an assignment requirement may be substituted (for example, a research paper versus an oral presentation for a student who is hearing impaired). Classes enrolled students with mobility impairments may have to be rescheduled in accessible facilities. The college or university may need to provide special services such as registration, note-taking, or mobility assistance. It is the students responsibility to notify his or her professors of the need for such an accommodation. Disability Services provides students with letters to present to faculty members to verify that the student has a disability and needs accommodations. Individuals requiring special accommodation should contact the professor after class or during office hours. Religious Holy Days The University of Texas at Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities for the travel to and observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section 11.20, Tax Code, Texas Code Annotated. The student is encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment. The student, so excused, will be allowed to take the exam or complete the assignment within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment. If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the chief executive officer of the institution, or his or her designee. The chief executive officer or designee must take into account the legislative intent of TEC 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the chief executive officer or designee. These descriptions and timelines are subject to change at the discretion of the Professor. Course Syllabus Page 6 ']\n",

Arts Far West: Michelle Macias, Language Arts High School Teacher and her 11-12th grade students. Developed by CCAC faculty leader Virginia Jardim, the project described here is one of four of its type that have taken place over the last two years. Content shifts in accordance with the interests of participants each semester and is jointly planned by lead faculty from CCAC and AFW. Participants change each semester and have involved CCAC English I and II students partnering with AFW students from sixth through twelfth grade. CCAC students and Arts Far West students met together for an hour a week, over an 8-week period. CCAC students were coaches to AFW students. Together they worked on reading, writing and bookmaking assignments. The project began by reading and discussing the \"The Broken Promise\" by Elouise Cobell, S.F. Chronicle 9/9/01. Cobell is a member of the Blackfeet Tribe and is suing the federal government of behalf of her people. To prepare for their work with the high school students, CCAC students first read and discussed the article, then researched the topic and developed questions for their first session with the high school class. Beginning with the second session, CCAC students worked in pairs with high school students. Their first assignment was helping high school seniors write essays for their college applications. This was a familiar challenge for the college freshman, who had written their own essays the previous year. As college mentors, CCAC students were able to give practical advice and support, as well as editorial assistance. In the third and following sessions, discussion focused on creation myths from the Pahute Indian tribe. Drawing inspiration from these stories, mentors and mentees learned bookmaking skills and worked together on inventing and illustrating their own myths. These books were exhibited on the CCAC campus and at the City of Oakland Gallery. English 1 Syllabus.pdf\\nTips for Journaling.pdf continue ']\n",

      "[' Right Reason: Common Sense And Theory Sep OCT JUN 28 2005 2006 2007 15 captures\\n28 Oct 06 - 6 Nov 08 Close\\nHelp Sviatoslav Richter |\\nMain\\n| Democracy and Minors March 20, 2005 Common Sense And Theory\\nIn the recent movie Chicago, a woman finds her husband at home in bed with another woman. Just prior to being shot dead by his wife, the husband asks her, ungrammatically and perhaps imprudently, Who are you going to believe, me or your eyes? This is the question that has been asked of the common man in recent years by the intellectuals of the Left, and fortunately the common man has been more tolerant than the fictional wife. It is the same as the question first raised by Hume with respect to Pyrrhonian skepticism. His answer was that it cannot be defeated by reason, but, have no fear, no one will believe it. Perhaps this was true of skepticism, but neither of these claims is true of current Leftist counter-intuitive theory. I think the Left can be defeated by reason and, as is all too sadly plain, it can all too often be believed. A defining difference between Conservative thinking and Liberal thinking, it has often been remarked, is the relative respect allotted to common sense, on the one hand, and theoretically driven complex reasoning, on the other. When these two come into conflict, it is said, the Conservative places the burden of proof over on to the counter-intuitive reasoning, while the Liberal places the burden of proof back on to common sense. This is rather beautifully modeled by Barry Stroud in his book, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism, when he deals with Moore and his two hands argument against Idealism. Very simply, Moore says that he knows there are two hands before him (holding them out and looking at them), Heres one, and heres another. The skeptic (Idealist) counters, But what about my argument showing that you cant know that? and Moore responds: Its unsound. I know that because it leads to a false conclusion. And, no, I dont know whats wrong with it; thats not my problem, its not my argument. Stroud describes this as a stand-off because, it seems to him, the antagonists have reached rock-bottom commitments that neither will abandon. This makes it seem as if both the Moore and the Idealist positions are, from a rational point of view, equally arbitrary. Yet, it seems to me that there is more to their positions, though admittedly, there are also pre-philosophical commitments involved.\\nIn both cases, I suggest, the antagonists are driven by preferences respecting explanation that can be seen in a mildly altered version of Quines model of human knowledge. In this model, common sense and science are not competing systems, but rather a part of continuous web of belief. His well-known image is that of an ellipse, with perceptual beliefs constituting the circumference and theoretical beliefs the center. Beliefs on the circumference are the most resistant to change, though not immune. Beliefs at the center are the least resistant to change, they include, for example, beliefs in the existence of theoretical entities. The relationship between the internal and circumferential beliefs is that the latter provide both the input and the output of an explanatory machine whose function it is to predict what we will be perceiving in the future. I want to locate the beliefs of common sense quite close to the circumference, let me call them peripheral. Respective locations within the web reflect the webs overall function, namely that of the prediction of future perception. This means that perception is inherently more privileged than theoretical assumption, since the latter is functionally subordinate to the former. To the extent that the deliverances of science (and pseudo-science) conflict with the beliefs of common sense, the burden of proof rests on them since the default presumption of truth lies with beliefs closer to the circumference.\\nAt the heart of the modern Leftist academics impulse is the attempt to force the capitulation of common sense, to force the ordinary man to accept the inadequacy of his own judgments in all arenas. The Liberal chooses to put his faith in the center of Quines ellipse, making the periphery and even the circumference of the figure change in order to preserve the center. The choice between these two models is not beyond psychological explanation. Yes, I know that generalizations of this kind are difficult to defend, but, then, I also believe that many racial/cultural stereotypes are fairly reliable predictors. I think Nietzsche captures the Liberal quite well in his sketch of Socrates as the ancient equivalent of todays Leftist university intellectual. He tries his best to make verbal reasoning the instrument of decision and if he fails at this, he feels utterly impotent once again. What is dignified suicide, after all, if not the last blow struck by the powerless? Contrary to their pacifist rhetoric, they are psychologically in the sad state of understanding only force in social interaction. Because they lack the means for its physical expression, they try to dominate by means of a narrowly defined intellectual force. The modern Liberal has neither the skill nor the inclination to persuade or negotiate. He is not, in an old still good sense of the word, political. He cannot be, because he does not really understand his environment, he feels the same impotence felt by new immigrants of not being on the inside. Some actual immigrants have dealt with that sense of powerlessness through the acquisition of wealth, others by forming groups who invent their own norms of power. Academe has become such a group, though of strange cultural immigrants, not national ones. A person descended from many generations within a country can still have this experience of being an immigrant to the culture by feeling, for whatever reason, disempowered and marginalized. They have fallen out of the culture.\\nIt is this that explains the rage of the university based academic Left. It is this that explains its constant harping on Bushs intelligence. For this contingent, the only legitimate world explanatory framework is the symbol-manipulative one at the center of Quines figure. They do not recognize it as a pragmatic fiction. It is the world in which clever talk is thought per se to influence events. Players who do not change their decisions and behaviors because of some argument in a journal of post-modern social/political/economic criticism are, well, just stupid or evil. A hysterical insistence on capitulation from ones opponent because one has the better argument reflects the kind of despair experienced by those who feel they have no access to the levers of power. Nowhere was this frustration more visible than in the Liberal response to the Kerry/Bush debates. \"Our man was the cleverer,\" they cried, \"why does he lose? Why are people so stupid?\"\\nFrequently, this kind of falling out of the culture can also be explained in historical terms. It expresses itself as a sense that the rules of the past have proven worthless and that now anything is allowed, and a frequent response is to put all confidence in a new faith with new rules. The French 17th C. experienced such a dislocation with the gradual erosion of the authority of Scholasticism. In that case, they turned to the new science. German youth experienced such a dislocation after Germanys defeat in the first World War. In that case, they turned to an extreme nationalism. It is likely that our current intellectual Left is a consequence of the sheer horror of the second World War, a post-traumatic turning to a brew of Marxism, science, and post-modern criticism. One can think of contemporary Liberalism as the socio-political equivalent of Esperanto, the rational language that failed, with the exception that it is both more successful in finding adherents and more dangerous.\\nThe problem is that reality, both physical and social, is far more complex than these fledgling sciences or the flourishing university-based pseudo-sciences can hope successfully to manage. On the other hand, our common sense is not only the instrument that Nature designed for this task, but it has been trained by generations and generations of experience for the management of life. Like Hume, Ill place my confidence in common sense over the deliveries of abstruse and abstract complex philosophy.\\nPosted by Jean-Pierre Schachter at March 20, 2005 6:38 PM\\n| TrackBack (0) Comments Professor Schacter,\\n\"Who are you going to believe...\" is only incorrect if \"you\" is incorrect in the singular, or \"So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by...\" is an unacceptable bastardization of \"Hwaet we Gar-Dena in gear dagum...\"\\nEven if you consider a prescriptive grammar tenable, it is exceedingly demanding to expect that a man\\'s last utterance upon the fatal discovery of his affair to be well-formed.\\nPosted by: Patrick O\\'Neill at March 20, 2005 8:10 PM Demanding? Yes. But we\\'re Conservatives, dammit! We hold ourselves to a stricter standard.\\nI like to think that each of us, under similar circumstances, would meet the occasion with grace, dignity, and a proper respect for syntax.\\nDon\\'t quite see how the Beowulf opening pertains to the grammar, but I\\'ll take your word for it that it\\'s ok,\\nJP\\nPosted by: Jean-Pierre at March 20, 2005 8:56 PM The translation of Beowulf given IS inaccurate. It should be: \"Lo. WE spear-Danes in days gone by... \"\\nPosted by: John Ray at March 20, 2005 10:30 PM Jeanne-Pierre, how bizarre that nearly half the American population has been marginalized and is no longer in synch with American culture! Is that even a conceptual possibility?\\nPosted by: marc at March 21, 2005 6:21 AM Marc-\\nI\\'m curious as to where you pull the \"half the American population\" number from. I can only guess that it is related to something like the close divide in the recent presidential election, or the number of registered Democrats and Republicans. Of course the first doesn\\'t capture the huge number of people who don\\'t vote, and of those who do vote it doesn\\'t capture the moderate conservatives and single issue voters. If it is something like the second I\\'d hope we wouldn\\'t conflate political parties with political philosophies. To be certain neither party captures a philosophy perfectly.\\nPosted by: Matthew Mullins at March 21, 2005 7:59 AM The left has a contempt for the past,unless it\\'s a Supreme Court decision they favor. The past argues against much of their intellectual foundation,such as it is,and must be discredited or ignored. If you can sweep away history and common sense with it you can clear the ground for a centralized state and a moral vacuum which opens the way for any number of negative social upheavals. But that\\'s tactical,the other part is egotistical and contrarian.They just have to know better. Forget Moore\\'s two hands,I like the note in Aristotle\\'s Metaphysics About the skeptic falling into a hole on the road to Megara,let him retain his skepticism of reality from the bottom of the hole.\\nPosted by: johnt at March 21, 2005 9:19 AM Matt, I thought about including a caveat about the voting public, but in point of fact it seems epistemically reasonable to think that the nonvoters either don\\'t accept the basic principles of conservativism (at least insofar as they are reflected in the republican and libertarian platforms) or they are more less evenly distributed across parties. In any event, I can\\'t see any reason to think that the nonvoters break decisively for conservatives. Similarly, I see no reason to think that there are more moderate conservatives than moderate liberals (if there is a difference between the two) or that there are more single issue voters who go republican than go democrat. ETC. But in any event, it would seem reasonable to think that there are almost as many liberals as conservatives in America, wouldn\\'t it? If so, the point stands.\\nPosted by: marc at March 21, 2005 9:21 AM Marc, Even if you split the population as you suggest, it\\'s actually quite a testimony to the hardiness of the traditional American spirit that only half of the population has gone French. Given the reach and influence of the MSM and the fact that the vast majority of the Universities are in the hands of the Left, not to mention High Schools and, even, Grade schools, it\\'s remarkable that even half of the population has not succumbed. In point of fact, I rather doubt that the divide is as even as you represent it.\\nPosted by: Jean-Pierre at March 21, 2005 9:37 AM I don\\'t think the theoretical backdrop and the chosen example were good fits were one another at all. Each could\\'ve made an interesting post alone; together, it\\'s just disjointed and strange.\\nThe example, however, was interesting: \\'what do we do when people disagree with us on important issues.\\' It\\'s an interesting question, but I don\\'t think the actual answer will track the political divide so well. Interesting idea, but you\\'re trying to cram it into the wrong boxes.\\nPosted by: jpe at March 21, 2005 9:45 AM I\\'m not sure the Quine \"periphery/center\" business applies altogether to social and moral matters. For one thing, almost everybody has principles they\\'re devoted to, and principles seem to belong to the center. So it\\'s not clear the center is more changeable than the periphery. For another, perceptions aren\\'t as theory-independent as in the natural sciences.\\nOn both the right and the left there\\'s a lot of \"we need to take our country back\" rhetoric these days. So it seems lots of people on all sides have \"fallen out\" of the culture (or feel the culture has abandoned them). That seems to reflect a situation in which large numbers of people hold opposing views as to what common sense says about human relations, politics and the like. Is it common sense that men and women are different, and that has to come out somehow in the way people live, or is it common sense that discrimination is an intolerable attack on the individual that must be stopped? Those differences spill over to perceptions. When we see a stay-at-home mom or a female fighter pilot or boxer do we see a triumph or a disaster?\\nIt seems to me that the radicalism of modern thought, including liberalism, has led through its triumphs to a situation in which it becomes very difficult to say what common sense says. Somehow common sense must be restored, but I don\\'t think that can be done simply by appealing to common sense, which has become quite ambiguous. Something more theoretical is needed to deal with the damage done by theory.\\nPosted by: Jim Kalb at March 21, 2005 9:50 AM Come to think of it: your selection of this particular example for the disjunction of common sense and theory is ill-advised. Far from there being some tension between the two vis-a-vis the election, the conclusion that people are idiots closely coheres with our experience and common sense.\\nIt\\'s not a mathematical plug that keeps our equations in balance; it\\'s an obvious extrapolation from everyday life. I\\'m on my way out the door to buy lunch, and I fully expect to interact with at least one idiot in that limited time.\\nPosted by: jpe at March 21, 2005 9:51 AM Jeanne-Pierre,\\nI don\\'t see how consciously affecting \"whom\" (and really, this is what most modern native speakers are doing when they throw down a \"whom\" in otherwise spontaneous speech) demonstrates a proper respect for syntax. The problem with insisting on whom is that there\\'s no way to consistently argue for clutching at the remnants of English\\'s moribund case system without concluding that the proper second person singular pronoun is not you, but thee, etc. Languages change, and whether we accept or reject this determines whether linguistics will give us insights into the structure of the mind or a set of rules in a schoolbook, vigorously drilled and happily forgotten. Because Right Reason is what it is, I would like to anticipate an argument that linguistic conservatism (here, efforts to resuscitate \"whom\") follows from political conservatism, to which I\\'d offer three responses. The first is that the premises which underlie a Humean respect for tradition in a system of political economy have no analogues in the framework of social linguistics. There are no rights to guarantee, no resources to be allocated, and the only utility we could speak of would be ease of intelligibility, which is never threatened by indiscriminate who\\'s, terminal prepositions or split infinitives. There is simply no reason to extend conclusions between the two. Secondly, reasoning to linguistics from political philosophy will probably take the prescriptivist places they (and yes, I would stick up for singular they as well) don\\'t want to go. What we have in French, say, is a continuous line of mutually intelligible generations of native speakers that has some how managed to pull a French lapin out of a Latin galea. This tradition of systematic, regular change in language is what we should like to preserve, though language is no less indifferent to our thoughts on the matter than the blink reflex or nerve conduction, and will continue to operate whether we\\'d prefer it or not. Lastly, I offer a counter-example in John McWhorter, a Berkeley linguist and Manhattan Institute scholar, whose Word on the Street is one of the best popular introductions to sociolinguistics around.\\nJohn,\\nWell, OK. Literally, we\\'d have \"What. We of-the-Spear-Danes in old days of-the-people-kings power heard\", where \\'we\\' is the subject, \\'heard\\' the verb, and \\'of-the-spear-Danes\\' the object. Quoting half of the original sentence makes it sound as though \"We the spear-Danes\" has the same structure as \"We the people\", which of course it doesn\\'t. I agree that that\\'s not as clear as it could be from my poor choice of excerpt. My attempted point was that by denying language change we\\'d have to believe that the modern English translation of Beowulf is not just subjectively more or less \"faithful\" to the original, but objectively wrong.\\nPosted by: Patrick O\\'Neill at March 21, 2005 10:09 AM Jean-Pierre (sorry about misspelling your name previously), as I recall educators have only a limited and generally passing influence on people\\'s political and religious beliefs. Developmental environment (family and friends) and current environment are the appropriate predictors.\\nI should add that I find the dichotomy commonsense/theory-driven pretty dubious to begin with. Perhaps conservatives think of their theories as commonsensical (perhaps by defining commonsense as whatever conservatives believe?), but I would think that it would be pretty hard to make a case, for instance, that conservative environmental policy is commonsensical (modulo the assumption that environmental degradation is pretty significant). Oftentimes what is commonsensical in a given circumstance is quite the opposite of what is conservative. Perhaps Bush\\'s doctrine of pre-emptive military action is commonsensical in response to 9-11, but arguably it wasn\\'t conservative.\\nPosted by: marc at March 21, 2005 10:24 AM Given the reach and influence of the MSM and the fact that the vast majority of the Universities are in the hands of the Left, not to mention High Schools and, even, Grade schools, it\\'s remarkable that even half of the population has not succumbed.\\nIsn\\'t this a hermeneutic of suspicion, which is one of the primary mode of marxist & post-structuralist thought?

I suppose we could entertain the concerns of a skeptic who demands that first the existence of an American society external to his mind be proven. On the other hand, one has to start somewhere, not in epistemological principle, but as a practical matter in deliberations of this sort.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 21, 2005 2:25 PM I\\'m not sure what to make of this post, so let me just second Patrick O\\'Neill\\'s remarks, especially his defense of singular \"they,\" which is perfectly good English. The OED lists it as the second definition, after the plural one and before the indefinite \"they\" of \"they say ... \", and gives examples going back to the 16th century. Here\\'s one from 1535: \"He neuer forsaketh any creature vnlesse they before haue forsaken them selues.\" I know J-P didn\\'t mention singular \"they,\" but, anyway, so there!\\nActually I do have a substantive remark. W/r/t skepticism and common sense, the issue is not \"common sense says X; should we believe it?\" but instead \"What is it exactly that common sense is telling us?\" That there is no (theoretically) \"innocent eye\" (that\\'s Gombrich) does not threaten our knowledge, but it can show how theoretical distortions can pass themselves off as \"pure\" common sense. Stroud is very good on this: he\\'s quite clear that there is no question of accepting (radical) skeptical conclusions (ie giving up our beliefs), but also insists, rightly, that as things stand we have no right to dismiss skeptical arguments as misguided. In this sense Moore is no help. Certain conceptions of knowledge face a theoretical difficulty which cannot be overcome by mere hand-waving (so to speak); and this difficulty reaches all the way to common sense affecting not its general reliability, as the skeptic (but not the idealist) argues, but instead its content and significance.\\nI\\'m also curious to hear Edward Feser\\'s reaction, given the scorn he poured on Robert Nozick the other day for the latter\\'s animus toward the \"coercive\" nature of rigorous argument.\\nPosted by: DF Maier at March 21, 2005 2:28 PM Jean-Pierre, you may want to clarify whom (who?) you\\'re criticizing here. Otherwise it sounds a bit like you endorse the type of \"conservative\" behavior exemplified below:\\nLiberal: I think gays should have the legal right to marry.\\nConservative: Your belief conflicts with common sense. Therefore, I reject it.\\nLiberal: Wait! I have some empirical evidence that allowing gays to marry would not harm society in any significant way. And it\\'s wrong to deny legal rights to citizens unless their exercise of those rights would trample on the rights of others. Since gay marriage does not transgress anyone\\'s rights, it would be wrong and perverse of us not to allow it.\\nConservative: I don\\'t need to listen to your theoretically-driven complex reasoning. I just know that gay marriage is wrong, by the light of common sense.\\nLiberal: My premises and rules of inference are commonsensical as well, at least as far as I know.\\nConservative: No they\\'re not.\\nLiberal: Well, what\\'s wrong with them?\\nConservative: They cannot accord with common sense, and that\\'s all there is to it. For common sense says that gays should never be allowed to marry.\\nLiberal: What if common sense contradicts itself?\\nConservative: It doesn\\'t.\\nLiberal: How do you know?\\nConservative: Common sense.\\nLiberal: All right. If that\\'s really what you think, I\\'m not sure that we have much to say to each other. But it does look rather intellectually uncurious of you not to evaluate my argument on its own merits, rather than just dogmatically clinging to your current beliefs.\\nConservative: I\\'m a dogmatist, am I? You people are all the same. You have neither the skill nor the inclination to persuade and negotiate, and so in the end you resort to name-calling and force. Liberal: Well, I admit that I\\'m currently lobbying for the legalization gay marriage. But I\\'m happy to engage in argument too, provided you\\'ll meet me halfway. Who knows, I may even learn something.\\nConservative: You dang kids are all so liberal these days. I blame the public schools. You might wish to put in a few words to rule out the highly uncharitable reading, on which you endorse the imaginary \"conservative\"\\'s position.

The claim about pestering a stranger in a bar IS provable, because it involves specific concepts and circumstances, clearly stated. The former claim about \"leftist bias\" in \"universities and news media\" is NOT provable, or disprovable, because the underlying concepts are poorly defined or undefined. Which \"universties and news media?\" Which \"leftists?\" What do we mean by \"bias?\" Proving such claims is like \"proving\" that someone is a \"murderer\" without stating exactly who he killed.\\nI do not doubt that SOME universities and news media have a leftward bias. I am responding here, however, to the allegation of \"the reach and influence of the MSM and the fact that the vast majority of the Universities are in the hands of the Left, not to mention High Schools and, even, Grade schools...\" This accusation is not borne out by ANY observation of mine, and is made here with insufficient evidence, and the supporting logic is so slipshod as to raise serious questions regarding the motives of the accusers - questions that only get sharper when they respond to criticism by rewording their original charges on the fly: \"left\" to \"left-of-center,\" \"universities\" to \"educational theory and the professors in education and the arts.\"\\nDon\\'t make vague accusations and then try to weasel out of them by saying \"It\\'s hard to prove, but does anyone here doubt it?\" You\\'re not fooling anyone who doesn\\'t want to be fooled.\\nPosted by: Raging Bee at March 21, 2005 3:07 PM Bee finds my argument is unsatisfactory, so he moves quickly to proclaim that I have perverse motives.

Look, if someone asked me Are universities and the MSM strongly biased to the left? Id answer sure. If they asked Are there exceptions? Id say sure again. If they asked How far to the left? Id say Good question. Not too many in the far left, really. Lots and lots at least somewhat left of center.\\nJust extrapolating on voting patterns in universities and newsrooms, Id be surprised to find that most of the overwhelming majority Democratic voters would describe themselves as conservative Democrats. Id also give prohibitive odds that if every faculty member or network or large newspaper journalist in the U.S. were strapped to a lie detector and forced to answer honestly Do you consider your politics liberal, moderate or conservative, the results would overwhelmingly show liberal.\\nNow, in that sense, and maybe that sense alone, there is some merit to Mr. Ryans Can you seriously doubt or deny it? claim. It remains to be asked, however, just how far to the left any or most of these folks are, whether their liberalism is of an economic or social variety or both, etc., etc.\\nBTW, Mr. Wizenbergs quip reminded me of my favorite Lenny Bruce story: My mother-in-law broke up my marriage....

Ridgely at March 21, 2005 5:27 PM General question:\\ndo terms like \"the Left\", \"the modern Liberal\", and the like behave enough like natural kind terms in order to support the kinds of generalizations being made here? If they do, then we might hope to get explanatory insight, predictive power, broad understanding, etc., by exploring the inner essences of \"the Left\", \"the modern Leftist\", \"the modern Liberal\" and their congeners.\\nBut if they are pretty loose labels on rag-tag assemblages that hardly share so much as family resemblances, much less underlying causal structures...? So: it seems to me worth asking whether there are any natural kinds to be understood here. (Or causal-cum-explanatory-generalization-supporters, if you want to cast that net wider than natural kinds, though to me those are still the paradigmatic cases).\\nPosted by: Tad Brennan at March 21, 2005 5:45 PM Rachael,\\nGreat post. Nice \\'n funny, too. Got my wheels turning quite a bit today, thanks Perhaps a reply would be as follows. Conservatives have been offering arguments, so it isn\\'t your liberal character who should kindly ask to be given a chance to hash things out. And conservative articles and books don\\'t even make a respectable showing on the syllabus in, say, an upper division political philosophy seminar. Furthermore, attempts to show that common-sense morals are incoherent can be shown to be unsound, but there is a certain hegemony, a holding-sway of leftist theories in academia that makes the task impractical. When a a fire hose issues forth, each drops can be turned away, in principle, but not all at once in their torrent. The forum is warped. Your large contingent occupies a funhouse of warped mirrors, and there\\'s only one or two poor saps who are charged to go to you one by one and attempt to show you that your persons don\\'t in fact have the bizarre shapes you think they have. There are too many of you. The one or two poor saps tire. They become cynical. They give up. Maybe they should. Their task may be too monumental.\\nIn connection with Jean-Pierre\\'s post, the poor saps would like to say that it is plain that you are standing in front of wobbly mirrors rather than looking at your actual bodies. You\\'re allowing yourselves to be blinkered. Your enormous and hegemonic body of theory grates against common sense in many ways. Bringing these ways to light is, though easy in piecemeal, simply too monumental a task en masse. Another analogy: First one spends loads of time showing that Singer book X does not in fact show that common-sense is incoherent, and as soon as one finishes, Unger publishes a slightly different version of the same argument, so now one must get to work on this task.... (Not that those two guys are centrally representative of mainstream academic leftism, but it\\'s an apt illustration.) It never ends. Inductive evidence shows that the torrent will never give any drops devastating to common-sense morals. Facing the flow becomes sisyphean, nauseating, and, in view of the preciousness of academia, education, and scholarship, depressing. One gives up.\\nAh, but I whine. Yet, I blog. At least here, in the blogosphere, my conservative arguments are considered, refuted, what have you. In academia, the extent to which this happens is negligible.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 21, 2005 6:25 PM Professor Schachter,\\nI agree that in political discourse, there will always be a conflict between those who take certain long established practices as their first principles, and those who will not do so. This division is, of course, not an absolute one- those who give the benefit of the doubt to the traditional way will occasionally go against it, and those who don\\'t see traditional way as a first principle will occasionally base their arguments on it. But it remains that certain citizens give the benefit of the doubt to they way things have traditionally been, and others do not. These traditional, established practices are called \"common sense\" according to the first meaning of the term (I\\'m pretty sure that this is the second definition of common sense given by the OED, but the first definition is not common, but technical.)\\nThe conflict between these two different groups of citizens must be perpetual, and one group cannot hope to refute the other so long as they remain merely followers of tradition/common sense or reactionaries against the traditional way. Neither tradition as such nor the rejection of it are self-evidently true, and therefore the rejection of either is not self-evidently false. Skepticism about whether self- evident truths can be known does not decide the issue one way or another, because skepticism is a sort of negation: an inability to decide. If we try to argue that tradition is more solid because it is the product of many minds, how can we do so unless- in one way or another- we make the positive claim that the product of many minds is generally closer to the truth? Even then, the conflict remains, for political actions concern particular things to be done, and in any particular case it is not evident that the traditional way is right. I accept that the eighteeth century French were fools for leaving traditional scholasticism, and the Germans of our last century were fools for turning to some new fad science. But what of the seventeenth century English? Closer to home, what about the eigtheenth century Americans, who saw fit to rebel against the traditional bods that had long tied them to England? I don\\'t mention that last example for nothing. It is in American history that the conflict between tradition/ rebellion against the traditional is most perfectly transcended. Here in America, our most solemn national holiday commemorates the day on which a convocation of statesmen declared that certain truths are to be held as \"self evident\", and that these same self evident truths are to guide all political action, so much so that \"whenever a government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, instituting in its place such forms of government that are more conducive of life and happiness.\" The American founding trancended and yet preserved the opposition between what is called in the article \"the left and right\" because it founded a regime based on self-evident truths. It is fair to notice that the self evident truths the founders enumerated are not self- applying: we must work to see how they manifest themselves in particular cases. But nevertheless, the realization of these self evident truths is all important, and they should be the foundation of all our political thought. The self-evidently true is in fact another definition of \"common sense\" and it is the definition that is all important. This common sense is the true foundation of at least the American republic, and it deserves to be the foundation of any community of persons.\\nPosted by: shulamite at March 22, 2005 4:16 AM oops.

If you can be sympathetic to Bush, you can forgive my shoddy writing too.\\nPosted by: shulamite at March 22, 2005 4:25 AM I suspect psychology may be better able than philosophy to address Mr. Brennans question. That is, I think that many peoples views are intellectually often little more than a rag-tag collection of diverse opinions which nonetheless tend to cluster in, lets say, extended family (or tribal or maybe even ethnic group) type resemblances, to stretch the Wittgensteinian metaphor.\\nEven so, while I find absolutely nothing per se connected about ones views on capital punishment, free trade, school vouchers, global warming, gay marriage, the UN and gun control, it nonetheless obtains as a fairly reliable general rule that if I know a persons position on one or two of these topics I can reliably predict his position on at least most the rest and many others.\\nNow, it happens that I think there must be some sort of subtextual political stickum (the political equivalent of Lockes something I know not what) which tends to bind or pull these sorts of views together. But, for what its worth, I dont think that stickum is as likely to be some sort of fundamental principle or set of principles or beliefs as it is some sort of psychological disposition having to do with how peoples fears and desires differ.\\nPosted by: D.A. Ridgely at March 22, 2005 7:15 AM Tad: thanx for the long-overdue questions. For what it\\'s worth, my attempt at an answer is this: in \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" circles, \"liberal\" and \"leftist\" have become nothing more than epithets on the level of \"nigger.\" Far from being clearly defined, they are used as a substitute for useful definition, to demonize large numbers of people at a time without having to discuss what those people actually believe or do.\\nPart of this is the fault of many of those people who are called \"liberal\" or \"leftist:\" they have failed, since the \\'70s, to define themselves, and have thus allowed their enemies to define them. Another part of the blame lies with their enemies, who have taken this opportunity to demonize them in order to justify treating them as subhuman, and avoid confronting the complex and important issues that \"liberals\" have tended to \"own.\"\\nIn order to inject some sense into the debate, I will attempt to reclaim the word \"liberal\" and define it as \"one who advocates policies that (in his/her opinion at least) tend to increase liberty for people overall.\" In John Locke\\'s time (when the word first came into wide use), \"liberal\" meant opposing absolute monarchy, tyranny, feudalism and \"divine right of kings,\" and supporting free enterprise (to increase economic liberty for all) and democratic forms of government (to increase political liberty for all).\\nToday, \"liberal\" tends to mean advocating increased political freedom for all, civil rights, and equality under the law; and opposing tyranny, bigotry and unequal standards of justice. In the economic sphere, it tends to mean advocating regulatory policies that reduce the freedom of businesses in order to increase that of consumers and smaller businesses.\\nAs for \"leftist,\" that word seems to represent a crowd who have lost all coherence since they threw their support to Khomeini in 1979. Anyone who calls himself a \"leftist\" today can bloody well define himself, thankyouverymuch.\\nPosted by: Raging Bee at March 22, 2005 8:34 AM Raging Bee: Is one to infer that your set of liberal objectives would or would not seek to restrict private bigotry other than through persuasion? Does equality under the law refer to merely procedural equality or does it presuppose the need or desirability of some sort of governmental leveling process either for more equal opportunity or more equal results? Would such economic regulations seek merely to avoid anti-competitive practices or otherwise \\'protect\\' consumers and smaller businesses?\\nPosted by: D.A. Ridgely at March 22, 2005 8:49 AM DA: I am advocating a set of general priorities and principles that I think should guide the making of policy. It is up to all of us as citizens and voters to discuss which specific policies will give us the best overall results for the most reasonable social and economic costs. This will mean, among other things, balancing conflicting interests and needs (i.e., the need to create jobs and meet material needs vs. the need to protect the environment for future generations); and admitting that there are limits to what can be accomplished by political means. I don\\'t have all the answers, but I am willing to admit that people not like myself have legitimate interests -- if you\\'re willing to return the favor.\\nPosted by: Raging Bee at March 22, 2005 9:13 AM Mr. Ridgely--\\nI think your questions to RBee are all fair ones to ask an individual. As soon as RBee answers them, he or she will be agreeing with some of the \\'liberals\\' whose fundamental stance was at issue, and disagreeing with others. The use of nails will not hold jello to a wall, but it will sometimes cause streams of jello to diverge to either side of the nail. (And I would attribute the same formlessness to the \"modern right\" \"modern conservatism\", etc. to the same degree and on the same grounds--it has no *theme*, as someone once said).\\n\"I suspect psychology may be better able than philosophy...\"\\nDo I hear an echo of \"malt does more than MIlton can\"? I\\'m not opposed to your outlook here, but I would probably accept a wider notion of \"philosophical\" enquiry, to include some of what you might be labeling \"psychology\". E.g., it would be of some philosophical interest if there were two fundamental psychological outlooks, which when followed consistently then led to the ramified array of opposing positions that are sometimes taken to characterize right and left. (Attempts have been made along this line, e.g. \"compassion\" vs. \"accountability\", \"liberty\" vs. \"welfare\", etc.).\\nWhat is striking to me is that the people I encounter whose views are most reliably predictable, and who most often follow a party line, are also the people who seem to have the least coherent underlying philosophy, and the least concern for the coherence of their various positions.\\nIn sharp contrast to them are the people who actually care about thinking things through in a careful and consistent way (the ones like me and thee, of course), whose resulting views always wind up fascinatingly contrarian and unpredictable. Talk to careful, thoughtful people, and they wind up taking a \"left\" view on abortion and a \"right\" view on Hollywood, or a \"right\" view on gun control and a \"left\" view on school prayer, and on and on. They are far from predictable, and they make bad party members (bless them).\\nStill, I agree with you that in many cases, and especially with the man on the street, if you see a Kerry sticker on their Volvo, or a Bush sticker on their Hummer, you can have some confidence in predicting their views on the list of topics you mention. The success rate is far above random chance. What explains these familiar facts?\\nSome want to discern a fundamental philosophical opposition. You would replace that with a fundamental psychological opposition, but you still accept a form of the \"subtextual stick-um\" model (and I doff my hat to you for that phrasing). I am a big fan of Lockean substance in metaphysics, but in politics my best guess is that what we are seeing is nothing more than the outcome of historical accidents, pure and simple. There are reasons, but not profound ones, why my Irish Catholic ancestors wound up in the coal mines of Pennsylvania, and reasons, but not principled ones, why people in the mines looked favorably on unions. And there was no stick-um, other than history, holding together Catholicism with union sympathy. It held together for many decades, then fragmented under the pressure of other historical events. History and politics are constantly making strange bedfellows; we deceive ourselves if we think those bedfellows manifest underlying natural kinds, or even family relations. (Oh dear--I\\'ve given you an opening for another joke about family members in bed together).\\nPosted by: Tad Brennan at March 22, 2005 9:21 AM Raging Bee, I am perfectly willing to admit people not like myself have legitimate interests and I think the best way for both them and me to pursue those interests is to leave each other alone as much as possible and, in particular, for the state to intervene as little as absolutely necessary. I asked the questions originally because different answers to how we go about balancing those conflicting interests you mention, and specifically what role the state should play in that process, often falls along the liberal / conservative fault line. Thus, for example, how one defines increasing political or economic freedom for all might lead to support for, say, affirmative action or it might lead to support for the notion that private businesses should be free to discriminate. It might lead to the conclusion that people should be free to take drugs or at least to drive without seatbelts or buy a car without airbags, or it might lead to the conclusion that the state must prohibit such exercises of freedom for the conflicting sake of public health or safety. In other words, few people from either the left or the right object to broad principles of economic or political freedom. The devil always lies in the details.\\nPosted by: D.A. Ridgely at March 22, 2005 9:24 AM D A Ridgely You left out higher taxes. Although the lines between parties are starting to blur one of the cohesive factors connecting your enumerated positions is the exixtence of said parties,that and a media that manages to find it\\'s own stickum. It\\'s rather like two sets of people rooting for two different fotball teams and not recognizing a need to explain why. As to words and labels,thru usage the term progressive has come to be aligned soley to a concept of gov\\'t as an engine of improvement and an automatic rejection of tradition. You might say that to the extent that there is an overarching belief or umbrella it is related to the misuse of this word. Shulamite, there will always be an argument over two things in any society larger than Crusoe\\'s island,change and how to change. Skepticism is a fine tool with which to erode the beliefs of others but have no doubt that in politics especially the skeptics have their own granite hard beliefs. Mr Ridgely comments on the psychology of fears and desires but what about the psychology of ego and dominance however vicariously held. Tradition/common sense are a wall erected against these two as expressed in the domain of politics and as imperfect as they are,being the product of imperfect beings,I owe my allegiance to them as I think you do also. As to the American Revolution,you may misread it. Most of the founders had no less than a tremendous admiration for the mother country and it\\'s institutions,i.e.Gouveneur Morris thought we to should have a king. I mention this only because of your reference to the tradition/rebellion dichotomy,but perhaps I misread it.\\nPosted by: johnt at March 22, 2005 9:42 AM Mr. Brennan:\\nAs usual, you make far too much sense for me to have much fun arguing with. (Except perhaps for that Lockean metaphysics business. Really now!) Ill gladly accept both your broader sense of philosophical and your contingent, historical account of how the proverbial man on the street (or in the coal mine) came to many of his political views.\\nIndeed, Id go on to claim that this sort of thing accounts at least to some extent to the political liberalism of many a man in the ivory tower, too, especially those in fields supposedly remote from politics. But so, also, with political scientists, economists, etc. and, yes, even philosophers. I dont accuse them collectively or, for the most part, individually of intentional dishonesty, but I do strongly suspect that their history and psychology invariably influence how they go about weighing conflicting theories, etc. As Ive often said in a different venue, philosophers bring more than their brains to the political debate. (Id go on, by the way, to say that in the groves of academe, certain social psychology phenomena can also be seen to occur, certain critical mass phenomena and, sadly, certain explicit political agendas when it comes to faculty hiring, promotions, etc. But that would be a different discussion, wouldnt it?)\\nPosted by: D.A. Ridgely at March 22, 2005 9:46 AM DA: You\\'re right. I would also add that we can best pursue our respective interests by thinking and speaking clearly, as George Orwell very strongly advised, and not misusing labels such as \"liberal,\" \"conservative,\" \"leftist\" and \"fascist\" for purposes of divisiveness, disinformation, and demonization, as con-artists and extremists of all \"persuasions\" are eager to do when they can\\'t \"persuade\" any other way.\\nPosted by: Raging Bee at March 22, 2005 9:55 AM Dear Shulamite (please call me Jean-Pierre),\\nThanks for your thoughtful response. I certainly agree with you that a tension between inherited attitudes and beliefs and new ones is not only healthy, but a necessary condition of a society/cultures survival (if I correctly read you). The key question is not this, I think, but rather the specific form taken by a revolutionary challenge. Once again, the metaphor that comes to mind is from Quine, out of Neurath, namely that of the raft of knowledge. I welcome the ongoing maintenance of the raft, even its repair or redesign, as long as the change is supportive of the objective of remaining afloat. In order for your model (and mine) to work, it is important that the innovators share this objective with the traditionalists and that they not be a deranged suicide cult willing to sink the raft out of hatred for the traditionalists. Yes, I understand that not all people on the Left belong to this tribe, but, like the millions and millions of peace loving Muslims we keep hearing about, the mild-mannered reasonable Leftists allow the hate-driven ones to speak for them. This noisy contingent has taken the podium in the MSM and in the universities, from where they exercise a dangerous power intent on preventing the very discussion you value. I found many of the responses to this post interesting for the fact that their very tone is evidence for the view they are themselves attacking, and they are tragically unaware of that. Several of these posts are filled with a kind of venom that signals we are not dealing here with friendly discussants of a common question, how to approach American life in the 21st C, but rather people driven by a rage that must have other sources than the topic under discussion.\\nBy all means, the social discussion is good and must continue, but, on the other hand, a fifth column flying under the colors of the loyal Left must be recognized, publicly identified, and resisted. Calling it a fifth column unfortunately suggests that all its members are cynical self-aware enemies of the nation; I certainly dont think that is the case. Many, if not most, have had a mantra provided for them that panders to their own psychological dispositions. The tune is always there among the people, and the cynics just supply the words. Extreme radical Leftism (or, for that matter, Rightism) is always a product of more than politics, it is always a disease of practical reason in which intuitive natural responses are undermined and transformed into weapons either against others or against those who hold the ideology themselves. I think it was Stalin who referred to the intellectual bourgeois Left of the West as useful idiots. And I think it may have been Nietzsche who remarked that an organism that has lost the ability to identify its enemies is doomed to extinction (or something like that). It is precisely this that has happened to the radical Left. It identifies those who wish to protect the country as the enemy and the attacker as the victim/friend. We have seen this happen on a smaller scale in the phenomenon of the Stockholm Syndrome, and, on a yet smaller scale, when the rape victim blames herself. Was my skirt too short? Was the rape my fault? she asks. The American Left asked, after 9/11, What did we do to make them hate us? Perhaps we wore our skirts too short.\\nWe recognize that this response is pathological when it occurs in hostages and when it occurs in a rape victim. I suggest it is no less a sign of a pathology, an ideologically based pathology, when it occurs after a terrorist attack.\\nThis is merely a dramatic example of the kind of problem I detect in the radical vocal Left, it is far from the whole. Examples can be multiplied endlessly.\\nYour example of the American Revolution is very interesting. If my memory serves me here, the revolutionaries were far from wild-eyed. Correct me if Im wrong, but wasnt this a revolution only reluctantly undertaken after England refused to address the colonys concerns? These were really Englishmen whom England forced into independence, not a population intent on bringing England down. The radical Left could emigrate to North Korea or China, but it chooses not to do so. The radical Left could establish communes in the U.S., but it chooses not to do so. The goal of the radical Left is power at any price, even at the price of first bringing the country to its knees before a foreign enemy. The Left endlessly inveighs against the sins of the arrogant superpower under whose umbrella it lives, but one has to strain to hear its criticisms of China and North Korea. The Left wanted to submit the power of the U.S. to the French, the Germans, and the U.N., and we still hear it saying that regardless of how corrupt these nations and institutions have proven to be.\\nThese positions all are _counter-intuitive_, and when this is pointed out, the response of the Left is that the Right is, as always, just _stupid_. These issues, says the Left, are complex and require high intelligence to understand. As a used-car dealer once told me when I questioned why it was that I was receiving no credit for my trade-in: Customers never understand these things. And the ordinary man just never understands the deliverances of the Left. We ordinary people, led by that fool Bush, are just so _stupid_!\\nIt is this issue of the attack on common-sense and intuition that interested me in my post.\\nPosted by: Jean-Pierre at March 22, 2005 11:18 AM Bee, please. I value your commenting at this blog. But you reach to quickly for \"weasel\" and \"con-artist\" in this case. I could quite easily say that you are a weasel and con-artist in your attempt to parse senses of \"left\" and \"control\" in effort to obscure the obvious fact that universities are in the hands of the left. But I wouldn\\'t say that because I don\\'t believe that it\\'s true.\\nI believe that the universities are in the hands of the left. I may be wrong. I also believe \"biased to the left\" is a reasonable, rather than inherently misleading, gloss on \"in the hands of the left\". I may be wrong. Show this. Move forward. Leave the invective out. When you move quickly to the invective you display a reflex shared with the sophistical con-men you speak of: bullying.\\nI stand with you against the slick-talking con-men and sophists of which you speak. I would venture to guess that I have a deeper and more consuming hatred of them than you do. But no one here meets their description, and I find that I must err to the side of controling my rage, lest I hit too many of the wrong targets with it. You rage too quickly in this instance, Bee.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 22, 2005 11:18 AM Jim: you\\'re the one making the accusation that \"the universities are in the hands of the left;\" so you\\'re the one who should be making the effort to prove it, rather than expecting others to disprove it.\\nOr, at the very least, try to clarify your accusations into something that can be independently quantified and/or verified.\\nI have read LOTS of anecdotes of specific professors and departments CLEARLY leaning to the left, to an irrational degree. I don\\'t doubt any of them in themselves; I only doubt that they add up to a monolithic, nationwide leftward tilt in academic learning and discourse. If there\\'s a conspiracy here, it sure as hell ain\\'t working!\\nI also doubt your accusation due to my own anecdote: I majored in International Relations at UVa, where the IR department leaned right (pro-US, pro-defense, and in one case, VIRULENTLY anti-Communist); the history dep\\'t. leaned a wee bit left (mildly anti-Nixon, sympathetic to both sides in Central American civil strife, sympathetic to Khomeini even during the hostage \"crisis\"); and I didn\\'t take enough liberal-arts classes to judge that dep\\'t\\'s leanings - or whether they even cared. I think the Law School was kinda rightish. We had a \"Socialist-Feminist Alliance,\" but also a Young Americans for Freedom chapter, and a gaggle of LaRouchies...oh, and some Maranatha dingbats shouting their hatred (oops, excuse me, God\\'s hatred) of gays and loose women.\\nI also doubt your accusations because you seemingly fail to account for the large number of private religious colleges in the US. I find it hard to believe that places like Bob Jones and Brigham Young Universities lean left. And what about state schools in the Deep South?\\nFinally, I doubt your accusation because similar accusations are made by people with extremist partisan agendas of their own, and who routinely cry \"BIAS!\" as a mantra to shout down any fact that doesn\\'t fit their own narrow world-view. I do not know you well enough to judge your motives; but the character of many of those who echo your accusations, and the venues in which I see such accusations, causes me generally to doubt their believability and their honesty.\\nI understand that professors can be biased, and can inject uninformed or obsolete prejudices into their teaching. But I also understand that extremists of all stripes work tirelessly to erode the credibility of any institution that would stand independent of their agendas - especially universities, the sciences (they don\\'t know the Bible!), the mainstream media, and any other independent source of factual information. I advise a little healthy skepticism toward both sides of this divide.\\nPosted by: Raging Bee at March 22, 2005 12:29 PM Mr. Ridgely--\\n\"As usual, you make far too much sense...\"\\nYou flatter me. But it shouldn\\'t surprise you that I side with common sense--I am a liberal, after all.\\nPosted by: Tad Brennan at March 22, 2005 12:43 PM The idea that academia in the U.S. does NOT have a pronounced leftward leaning is at such variance to all of my experience, that I can do nothing but duplicate the response that David Lewis encountered when proposing his plurality-of-worlds hypothesis:\\nAn incredulous stare.\\n(I admit it doesn\\'t work very well on a comment to a blog posting.) :|\\nPosted by: Peter Wizenberg at March 22, 2005 12:56 PM Perhaps, Mr. Brennan, although my experience has been that good sense, either among liberals or conservatives, tends not to be all that common.\\nPosted by: D.A. Ridgely at March 22, 2005 1:09 PM D A Ridgely re 1:09 post Among whom then,among these two unfortunate camps,would it be more common? Signing off for now,be back later.\\nPosted by: johnt at March 22, 2005 2:23 PM Bee: I do not know you well enough to judge your motives; but the character of many of those who echo your accusations, and the venues in which I see such accusations, causes me generally to doubt their believability and their honesty.\\nNo, further insult embellished by churlish pseudo-apology won\\'t do.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 22, 2005 3:37 PM I didn\\'t have time to read all of the responses, so I apologize if my observation is redundant.\\nI\\'m a undergraduate economics student, and I share your distaste for the academic left. At the same time, I think your association of \"liberalism\" with a relatively greater resistance to empirically informed common sense is unfair. This is especially true with regard to liberal economic doctrines. Much of economics is all about overcoming one\\'s knee-jerk, common-sense impulses and reasoning through things a priori. In my observation, the more economic training people have, the more I think they are prepared to interpret their \\'periphery\\' to conform to their \\'center\\'. If you don\\'t believe me, check out mises.org, where every real-world event is smashed into an Austrian conceptual box. Of course, in a broader sense, I do believe that that (historical) empirical data also supports free-market economics, at least by comparison with socialism and communism. But in my experience, Liberals--even those with economics training--find these sorts of historical arguments much more persuasive than the sort of theoretical/conceptual arguments that are the stock in trade of academic economists.\\nPosted by: Andrew Kushner at March 22, 2005 9:33 PM jeez, it told me that it hadn\\'t submitted properly three times in a row. my apologies for the redundant posts.\\nPosted by: Andrew Kushner at March 22, 2005 9:35 PM Dear Jean Pierre,\\nI see no way around making a post that is inordinately long, since the argument here is subtle and I think it is essential to get it right. My response will proceed in two parts:\\n1.) I will restate the argument as I understand it so far; 2.) I will give a more general account of what my position is, and how I think it is alike and different to yours. Your initial post noted a difference between two different ways of thinking about political affairs, and it sought a resolution to the difference. The difference noted was that those of the right give the benefit of the doubt to common sense, whereas those of the left do not, but choose rather to deny common sense when it comes into conflict with theoretical reasonings. You give two characteristics of common sense: a.) Common sense is a sort of belief that is very near the beliefs that \"provide both the input and the output of an explanatory machine whose function it is to predict what we will be perceiving in the future.\" and also;\\nb.) Common sense is a sort of belief that \"has been trained by generations and generations of experience for the management of life.\"\\nOn the basis of the first meaning of common sense, you establish a priority of common sense by the following argument:\\n-What relates more to the overall function of predicting future perceptions deserves the benefit of the doubt, and -common sense does this more than theoretical reasoning, since it provides the imput and output for theoretical beliefs. You also bolster up the second premise by your second given characteristic of common sense, that common sense is a set of beliefs that has a proven track record of dealing with the experience of human life. Now, for a more general account of my own position.\\nI agree that common sense does in fact provide the imput for theoretical reasoning, and that it judges its output. So long as there is a dispute between common sense and theoretical reasoning, common sense does deserve the benefit of the doubt. Here we agree wholly. But there are also certain things that are capable of judging both common sense and theoretical reasoning: for example, \"nothing can both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect\" (even the most die hard skeptic or critic cannot survive without the principle of contradiction). This principle, and others like it, transcend both common sense and theoretical reasoning. This transcendence allows for theoretical reasoning to refute even common sense, if theoretical reasoning can succeed in showing how it is more closely allied to the transcendent principle. In other words, even though theoretical reasoning is incapable of refuting common sense in a head to head fight, it is capable of overcoming it if it gets the trump card of a transcendent principle. Now everyone admits that theoretical reasoning has found this trump card some number of times; and in fact there is a certain kind of reasoner who seems to define science itself as a sort of refutation of common sense. (My only problem with those who define science in this way is that they are notorious for ignoring that they only refuted common sense by appealing to something more known than common sense- far from being skeptics, they are actually affirming some transcendent truth that can refute common sense.)\\nNow if theoretical reasoning can appeal to something beyond common sense, then common sense can, of course, also appeal to something beyond itself in order to justify itself. But at some point- and this is the soul of my whole argument- both common sense and theoretical reasoning end up appealing to some transcendent truth in order to justify themselves. When I say \"at some point\" I mean this as an epistemic point. Any particular belief of Common sense or theoretical reasoning has either been a manifestation of some transcendent truth all along, or they have never been right. This is one reason why these truths deserve to be called \"transcendent\". We can only discover them and recognize their reality. To take a famous example: Dred Scott was either in fact a man all along, or he was not. This was why I brought up the example of the American revolution. The Americans were bound by a long tradition to England, but they rejected that longstanding tradition on the basis of self evident truths. We can qualify and critique this move as much as we want, but at the end of the day, we are still confronted with this: these founders declared that the foundation of all government was a body of self-evident truths, and we must either agree or disagree with them. Regardless of how we respond, the ramifictions of our response will go to the core of our political beliefs. The things we hold as foundational truths are not truths far off, distant, and unimportant to our lives. They are the bedrock of our own beliefs or knowledge even now. We can only accept our foundations or ignore them.\\nPosted by: shulamite at March 23, 2005 1:06 AM Shulamite, that was fabulous. I wonder what you would have to say about this response to your view. I agree with both you and Jean-Pierre.\\nYou list two \"transcendent\" and \"foundational\" truths - that Dred Scott is a man, and the principle of contradiction, and you allude to American Revolutionary views, such as that people have a right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These seem to me to flow from the principle of contradiction, or at least to be so closely tied to it as to make it clear to me that the foundational truths you refer to are cases of simple (hence self-evident) entailments inherent to the meanings of important moral terms. So, I think your proposal is merely to remind us that common sense can indeed be overridden: by the principle of contradiction.\\nFor example: No one knows what would count as evidence that Dred Scott, under the description of him that, as everyone knows, could be easily empirically verified, is not a man. No one knows what would count as evidence that people do not have a right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. (Indeed, no one has ever put forth any such evidential criteria.) Man, Dred Scott, freedom, and happiness are terms that are conceptually (your \"transcendently\" or \"foundationally\") related in such a way that we cannot conceive of a wedge that could come between any two of them and rupture their relation. Proposals, such as \"but he\\'s black,\" or \"but they don\\'t have blue blood,\" are so easily refuted by showing that they are based on inconsistencies and incongruence with various empirical facts that they quickly fall away. No proposal of evidential standards withstands the slightest scrutiny. Show me where the liberating revolutions, such as abolition, American Revolution, women\\'s sufferage, etc. were a matter of parties devoted to two different transcendent truths and thus butting heads, rather than cases in which one of the two parties was able to show that the other\\'s position, though perhaps counting as common sense itself, was a case of an inconsistent use of common-sense terms. The one side was always able to show that the other was incoherent.\\nSo, your proposal might therefore be reducible to an amendment to Jean-Pierre\\'s position: that common sense be accorded epistemic priority except in cases in which contradictions between common-sense beliefs are discovered. When a common-sense belief (e.g., blacks may be enslaved because they aren\\'t people) is discovered to conflict with another, we inevitably can find that one of the two is the deviant from the largest and most coherent set of common-sense beliefs and must therefore be banished from this priviledged set forever.\\nOf course, you needn\\'t except that unless you agree with me that it\\'s incoherent to say that Dred Scott (\"under the description....\") isn\\'t a man because he is black, or that people may pursue happiness unless they are not of royal lineage. And you\\'ll agree with me on that point only if you accept that the nonexistence of evidential conditions under which we could accept either of those odious statements is proof enough that they are incoherent. But as a matter of historical fact, the important revolutionary arguments were won by the demonstration of the reactionaries\\' incoherence, not simply by people just seeing a transcendent truth that justified relinquishing the past.\\nIn any event, this is a way to remove the dispute between you and Jean-Pierre by making your position a corollary to his, rather than a competitor to it. Of course, I\\'d be quite keen to see any insight you might have on this.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 23, 2005 8:25 AM Mr. Ryan--\\n\"that common sense be accorded epistemic priority except in cases in which contradictions between common-sense beliefs are discovered.\"\\nThis seems eminently sane to me (I don\\'t know what Shulamite or Prof. Schachter will say).\\nBut it is a principle that is equally endorsed by people across the philosophical spectrum--it opens the door to Rawlsian reflective equilibrium. As I said in some exchanges with Prof. Bonevac on his post on Singer, it is a principle that Singer, too, would claim to be adhering to. And it is very hard to show that he is *not* adhering to it.\\nSo I\\'m not sure if Prof. Schachter should accept your amendment, friendly as it may be.\\nPosted by: Tad Brennan at March 23, 2005 8:29 AM Yes, I\\'m all in favor of reflective equilibrium, as long as that means the successful monitoring of the set of common-sense values we accept for those outliers: the common-sense values that are inconsistent with the enormous and coherent set of other common-sensee values. In that sense, Singer has no reflective equilibrium. He has a coherent set of values, perhaps, but he got them by simply cutting away the bulk of common-sense values. And Singer has not shown that ol\\' American values are so far from reflective equilibrium that we should relinquish them as he does.\\nThat\\'s just the point. Shulamite has a transcendent value. Suppose that it is that \"Every American deserves health insurance.\" (I have no idea whether Shulamite believes that or even is left of center.) His duty would be, just as in the case of the American Revolution, abolition, and sufferage, to show that contradicting this value puts one at odds with the largest and most coherent set of common-sense values we share. He cannot hope to justify a revolution by getting people just \"to see\" that his value is true by intuition. That\\'s not the way rational moral progress works. It works by discovering common-sense values that betray the others by contradicting them.\\nThis is a conservative threshold I am proposing that any change in values must surpass before being warranted. It is rationalistic protection against claims that revolution may be justifed by by someone\\'s inuitive grasp of moral facts; it may not. That blacks are not not people and so may be enslaved was found to be indefensible in debate, not merely counterintuitive. The contrary position was found to be defensible given the meanings of terms, not merely intuitively compelling. I\\'m not arguing against Shulamites position, unless he means precisely this hard intuitionist position. I\\'m offering a construal of his notion of fundamental fact which I think adheres smoothly to his explanation of his own view, especially insofar as he used the principle of contradiction to explain it.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 23, 2005 9:50 AM \"outliers\", \"the enormous and coherent set\", \"the bulk\"\\nMr. Ryan--\\nThese are the kind of terms I think it is easy to grant at the level of intuitions, and hard to precisify at the level of method. What are the metrics behind such judgements? How many beliefs are there in common sense beliefs, and how do we count them? If I deny that Norwegians are persons, is that one belief or 4 million? And having counted them, how do we weigh them?\\nLook, I would be happy to discover metrics that could show where Singer took the exit-ramp from the planet. I think discovering such metrics is a central aim for philosophy. What I am denying is that we have them yet. What we have so far, instead, are intuitions. You claim that Singer has not reached a reflective equilibrium. I think he has reached one, but it is badly skewed in favor of some common-sense beliefs rather than others. Still, to make good the claim that he is employing a method distinct from the method of RE, or employing it in a distinctively vicious way, I think we would need to be able to answer the metric questions much more clearly than we can.\\nI just don\\'t think we have arrived at a point yet where we can point to bright-line differences of method. We can point to lousy counter-intuitive conclusions, and fight them with clearer and less costly intuitions. We can argue that the Singers of the world are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. But the analogy is inapposite, because both the baby whom we want to preserve and the bathwater that we wish to discard are constituted by the same sort of stuff--intuitions and beliefs that can find some support from common sense.\\nPosted by: Tad Brennan at March 23, 2005 11:04 AM I think he has reached [reflective equilibrium], but it is badly skewed in favor of some common-sense beliefs rather than others.\\nYou know this, Mr. Brennan. Yet, you lack a \"metric\" for gauging epistemic justification in normative inquiries. Therefore, you don\\'t need a metric. (Incidentally, \"badly skewed\" means that he has not reached RE in the sense in which I defined it. So, I\\'m not sure you and I disagree on whether he\\'s reached it, in either your sense or mine. If he had only one moral belief, that would be RE in your sense, I think, but not in mine.)\\nFurther proof that a \"metric\" is not needed: People frequently obtain justification for their moral beliefs by arguing by analogy to widely shared moral beliefs and getting their facts straight (including making deductions). There is no \"metric\" for analogical coherence, \"widely shared,\" \"straight,\" etc., and yet they perform this feat. For instance, we don\\'t need to know whether \"widely shared\" means >45%, >51% or >85% of the population, in order to use the term properly. I think its a general point. Scientists don\\'t need a metric in order to tell that a theory has been robustly confirmed. Epistemic justification may be grasped, and it may be explained. But it can\\'t be quantified.\\nPosted by: Jim Ryan at March 23, 2005 11:58 AM To all who are interested:\\nI put up a more developed account of my own argument at my own blog:\\nwww.waitingforelijah.blogspot.com\\nPosted by: shulamite at March 23, 2005 7:48 PM Post a comment Name: Email Address: URL: Security Code: Remember personal info?\\nYesNo Comments: ']\n",

Faculty members are authorized to provide only the accommodations requested by the Disability Support Services Office. The ADA office for the Southwest College and Dr. Becky Hauri can be reached at 713-718-7910. Special accommodations can be provided to only those students who show proper documentation. HCC Policy Statement: Academic Honesty A student who is academically dishonest is, by definition, not showing that the coursework has been learned, and that student is claiming an advantage not available to other students. The instructor is responsible for measuring each student's individual achievements and also for ensuring that all students compete on a level playing field. Thus, in our system, the instructor has teaching, grading, and enforcement roles. You are expected to be familiar with the University's Policy on Academic Honesty, found in the catalog. What that means is: If you are charged with an offense, pleading ignorance of the rules will not help you. Students are responsible for conducting themselves with honor and integrity in fulfilling course requirements. Penalties and/or disciplinary proceedings may be initiated by College System officials against a student accused of on a test, plagiarism, and collusion. Cheating on a test includes: Using materials not authorized by the person giving the test; Collaborating with another student during a test without authorization; Knowingly using, buying, selling, stealing, transporting, or soliciting in whole or part the contents of a test that has not been administered; Bribing another person to obtain a test that is to be administered. Plagiarism and the unacknowledged Collusion mean the unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing written work offered for credit. Possible punishments for academic dishonesty may include a grade of 0 or F in the particular assignment, failure in the course, and/or recommendation for probation or dismissal from the College System. (See the Student Handbook) HCC Policy Statements Class Attendance - It is important that you come to class! Attending class regularly is the best way to succeed in this class. Research has shown that the single most important factor in student success is attendance. Simply put, going to class greatly increases your ability to succeed. You are expected to attend all lecture and labs regularly. You are responsible for materials covered during your absences. Class attendance is checked daily. Although it is your responsibility to drop a course for nonattendance, the instructor has the authority to drop you for excessive absences. If you are not attending class, you are not learning the information. As the information that is discussed in class is important for your career, students may be dropped from a course after accumulating absences in excess of 12.5% hours of instruction. The six hours of class time would include any total classes missed or for excessive tardiness or leaving class early. You may decide NOT to come to class for whatever reason. As an adult making the decision not to attend, you do not have to notify the instructor prior to missing a class. class. Poor attendance records tend to correlate with poor grades. If you miss any class, including the first week, you are responsible for all material missed. It is a good idea to find a friend or a buddy in class who would be willing to share class notes or discussion or be able to hand in paper if you unavoidably miss a class. Class attendance equals class success. HCC Course Withdrawal Policy If you feel that you cannot complete this course, you will need to withdraw from the course prior to the final date of withdrawal. Before, you withdraw from your course; please take the time to meet with the instructor to discuss why you feel it is necessary to do so. The instructor may be able to provide you with suggestions that would enable you to complete the course. Your success is very important. Beginning in fall 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a law limiting first time entering freshmen to no more than SIX total course withdrawals throughout their educational career in obtaining a certificate and/or degree. To help students avoid having to drop/withdraw from any class, HCC has instituted an Early Alert process by which your professor may you might fail a class because of excessive absences and/or poor academic performance. It is your responsibility to visit with your professor or a counselor to learn about what, if any, HCC interventions might be available to assist you online tutoring, child care, financial aid, job placement, etc. to stay in class and improve your academic performance. If you plan on withdrawing from your class, you MUST complete the process PRIOR to returning to the same online enrollment page that you used to originally register for classes. From the drop-down menu, select enrollment drop instead of enrollment add. **Final withdrawal deadlines vary each semester and/or depending on class length, please visit the online registration calendars, HCC schedule of classes and catalog, any HCC Registration Office, or any HCC counselor to determine class withdrawal deadlines. If you do not withdraw before the deadline, you will receive the grade that you are making in the class as your final grade. Registration Office, or any HCC counselor to determine class withdrawal deadlines. Remember to allow a 24-hour response time when communicating via email and/or telephone with a professor and/or counselor. Do not submit a request to discuss withdrawal options less than a day before the deadline. If you do not withdraw before the deadline, you will receive the grade that you are making in the class as your final grade. Repeat Course Fee The State of Texas encourages students to complete college without having to repeat failed classes. To increase student success, students who repeat the same course more than twice, are required to pay extra tuition. The purpose of this extra tuition fee is to encourage students to pass their courses and to graduate. Effective fall 2006, HCC will charge a higher tuition rate to students registering the third or subsequent time for a course. If you are considering course withdrawal because you are not earning passing grades, confer with your instructor/counselor as early as possible about your study habits, reading and writing homework, test taking skills, attendance, course participation, and opportunities for tutoring or other assistance that might be available. Classroom Behavior As your instructor and as a student in this class, it is our shared responsibility to develop and maintain a positive learning environment for everyone. Your instructor takes this responsibility very seriously and will inform members of the class if their behavior makes it difficult for him/her to carry out this task. As a fellow learner, you are asked to respect the learning needs of your classmates and assist your instructor achieve this critical goal. Use of Camera and/or Recording Devices As a student active in the learning community of this course, it is your responsibility to be respectful of the learning atmosphere in your classroom. To show respect of your fellow students and instructor, you will turn off your phone and other electronic devices, and will not use these devices in the classroom unless you receive permission from the instructor. Use of recording devices, including camera phones and tape recorders, is prohibited in classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, and other locations where instruction, tutoring, or testing occurs. Students with disabilities who need to use a recording device as a reasonable accommodation should contact the Office for Students with Disabilities for information regarding reasonable accommodations EVALUATION AND GRADES: Your final grade will be calculated according to the following core competency formula: A. The best four of five hourly exams and your final exam will be averaged and weighted 80%. Reading, computational and listening objective. B. Aplia Graded Assignments are weighted 20% of your final grade. C.

Strongly recommended:\\ncompletion of literature survey sequence.\\nDisability Accommodations Statement: Any individual who qualifies\\nfor reasonable accommodation under The Americans With Disabilities Act\\nor Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 should contact the instructor\\nimmediately.\\nStandard Civility Statement: All students are expected\\nto attend class fully prepared with appropriate materials and all devices\\nwhich make noise turned to the off position (e.g., cellular phones, pagers,\\npersonal stereos, etc.). Any student behavior deemed disruptive by\\nthe professor will result in expulsion of the student from the classroom,\\nwith an absence for the day and possible disciplinary action. It is best\\nnot to have your phone out while you are in the room: I am not responsible\\nfor returning it to you if you leave it behind. It must not ring during\\nthe class; it is extremely disruptive and rude and may be a violation of\\nAcademic Honesty regulations to use it when the class is in session or\\na quiz is being given.\\nThe Professor Expects that you follow standard protocols of\\nclassroom behavior, abide by the JSU Student Handbook, and conform to particular\\nrequirements of assignments and class discussion as announced.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nTo study the plays of Shakespeare in their critical and historical\\ncontexts; to understand the ways that changing cultural contexts affect\\nthe production and interpretation of Shakespeare.\\nTo understand the background for Shakespeare\\'s plays, including, where\\nappropriate, the study of Shakespeare\\'s sources.\\nTo understand the literary and dramatic aspects of the plays.\\nTo study the dramatic aspects of the plays with attention to what is\\nlearned from comparative production analysis, especially through films,\\npublished reviews, and creative approaches to the staging of Shakespeare.\\nTo develop critical skills in responding to literature, to be able to\\nwrite critically and personally about the literature (and the different\\ngenres of literature) in ways that demonstrate understanding and appreciation\\nfor the variety of interpretations that literature invites.\\nTo exercise students\\' techniques of critical thinking, questioning,\\nand problem solving.\\nATTENDANCE POLICY. Cutting class is strongly discouraged. Because\\ndiscussions, writing exercises, quizzes, and in-class assignments are graded\\nor prepare you for graded work, cuts will likely affect your grade. The\\ndepartmental attendance policy for this course mandates that you attend\\nat least 75% of classes to receive a passing grade. Unlike composition\\ncourses, there is no difference between excused and unexcused absences;\\nbut if you miss two or more classes in a row, I consider it courteous and\\npart of your responsibility as a student to speak to me about what you\\nhave missed and whether there is a need to make up work. There is no \"Withdraw\\nPassing\" from the course allowed after you have exceeded your limit of\\n7 cuts (For TTH classes, 8 cuts = automatic F). Even though tardiness and\\nleaving early are not officially counted as a partial absence, understand\\nthat it is extremely discourteous and rude. When you have unavoidable reasons\\nfor arriving late, leaving early, or otherwise attending the class sporadically,\\nplease inform the instructor ahead of time. The professor reserves the\\nright to count these occasions as partial absences, but you will be warned\\nahead of time and notified as to the way any partial absences is recorded.\\nWhenever in doubt, make sure to verify your record of attendance. Midterm\\nand major assignments can be made up only at the discretion of the instructor\\n(you better have a good excuse for failure to attend on days when a major\\nassignment is scheduled). I always drop the lowest quiz grade, and sometimes\\noffer occasions to do makeup work (different assignments) to improve your\\nquiz average. Otherwise, quizzes and daily class work cannot be made up.\\nExceptions made only in unusual circumstances.\\nREQUIREMENTS.

Its purpose is to share teaching strategies and\\ngenerate communication to other teachers from classroom-based research.\\nFor this reason, I may retain selected written work in order to quote from\\nit. Before doing so, I will first request permission from any students\\nwhose work I anticipate using. Assume that all anonymously collected evaluations\\nmight also be quoted.\\nMy quizzes tend to vary a great deal in format.\\nYou should always be prepared for a rigorous quiz that tests the basic\\ncontent of the play--keeping characters straight, knowing the plot--on\\nthe first day the play is listed on the syllabus. Depending on your\\nschedule, some of you may be invited to preview films outside of class\\nand under my supervision, or do background reading, with a report to the\\nclass averaged as an additional quiz. Occasionally, there may be unannounced\\nquizzes, which may take the form of open-book exercises, short essays,\\ndiscussions, or reports on group work. I drop the lowest quiz, then average\\nthe remaining grades for one-fourth of your grade for the course.\\nAll formal written work, including the critical paper\\nand test essays for the course should conform to the standard MLA format.\\nRemember that when quoting from verse plays, it is necessary to list Act,\\nScene, and line numbers. There are two acceptable ways to do this. Whenever\\nyou use a quotation for class purposes, especially on the Midterm, Class\\nPaper, and Final, get into the habit of proper citation form. Chose one\\nor the other style and be consistent:\\nArabic numbers with periods (no spaces) separating the\\nnumbers: 4.3.115-117. Roman numerals with commas and spaces: IV, iii, 115-117.\\n(Beware of secondary sources which include quotes which do not contain\\nthese references. Electronic editions of the plays may also contain unnumbered\\nlines.)\\nInformation that comes from a CRITICAL source must always\\nbe properly introduced and identified. This includes MONARCH NOTES, CLIFF\\nNOTES, electronic resources, and all other guides to the plays. It is academic\\ndishonesty not to give complete credit to your source, whether or not the\\nidea is directly quoted. This course is not designed to require a great\\ndeal of critical scholarship, but I expect that those who do want to make\\nuse of, refute, or expand on interpretations of the play by previous scholars\\nwill check with me to make sure that they are using proper methodology.\\nNOTE WELL: The instructor respects student individuality and innovative\\ninterpretive strategies. Group work and class discussions aim for the most\\npopulist/democratic discussion: all students encouraged to contribute;\\nthose monopolizing discussion time will be asked privately to moderate\\ntheir vocal responses. You are expected to maintain academic standards,\\nto turn in only original work, and to properly credit all sources not your\\nown. This class is designed to properly train and assist you in doing so.\\nYou are expected to comply with the JSU Student Handbook with reference\\nto all issues including code of conduct and academic dishonesty. Whenever\\na grade dispute, an attendance record dispute, or other issues of decorum\\narise, your FIRST responsibility is to arrange conference with the instructor.\\nI will distribute detailed guidelines for the paper at\\na later date. All topics must be approved. Note well: I will explain my\\nphilosophy and policies on the use of film to study Shakespeare in the\\nnear future. I am working to incorporate electronic literature into all\\nmy courses. I will speak more about possible projects for this course than\\ninclude work with electronic texts of Shakespeare and Internet sites.\\nThose of you who are interested in the Internet or use\\nof Computer technology with study of Humanities should strongly consider\\nfor your critical paper a project which makes use of these interests.

Each section is devoted to\\rone theme, beginning with biblical texts, followed by rabbinic,\\rmedieval and modern readings. Our goal will be to understand and\\rassess the different meanings of creation, revelation, and God in the\\rhistory of Jewish thought. Course Requirements Each student is required to attend and participate in class\\rdiscussions, and be prepared to discuss the assigned class readings. Three five-seven page (double-spaced) papers. The first paper\\rmust be reworked and handed in again as a rewritten paper (only this\\rsecond draft will be graded). Each paper will analyze a specific\\rissue, problem, question, or text relevant to class discussions. No\\radditional readings or library research is required for these papers. One five-minute class presentation. These presentations are your\\rchance to set the agenda for class discussion. They should focus on\\rparticular problems, questions, or criticisms you have concerning\\rthat day\\'s reading assignment, with the intent to open discussion on\\ra particular issue, text, or question. They should not summarize the\\rreading material, nor should they go beyond the five minute time\\rframe. I will present a list of classes on Thursday, Sept. 4th, and\\ryou can sign-up for any available day. I will do the first class\\rpresentation on Thursday, Sept. 4th, so that you get some sense of\\rwhat this is about. I have posted two folders under the name \"Rel. 120a\" on the\\rfaculty server on the internet. One is a \"drop box\", in which you\\rcan send me papers or comments that only I will read (others cannot\\ropen files once they are put in the box). The second folder is a\\r\"sharing box\", in which everyone can drop in notes, comments, and\\rsuggestions that everyone else can read. This second box will be\\ruseful for those giving class presentations. The day or so before\\rclass, you can post suggestions about what to focus on in the reading\\rin order to better prepare for class. Also, comments that were not\\raired in class can be posted in this folder to vent out some\\rfrustration. I will certainly use this box when I have comments\\rabout a previous class or want you to think about a few questions\\rbefore the next class. For this to work, we all must regularly check\\rthe posted folders. I will have more to say about this in class. Final exam Course Grading Class participation (class presentation included) (10%) Three 5-7 page papers (20% each paper, total 60%) Final Exam (30%) Reading List Holtz, Back to the Sources Soloveitchik, Lonely Man of Faith (strongly recommended) Spinoza, Tractatus Plaskow, Standing Again at Sinai Heschel, God in Search of Man Reading Packet All books (except reading packet) are on reserve in the Magill\\rLibrary at Haverford. Each book is listed according to their call\\rnumber on reserve. There is one additional copy of Soloveitchik\\'s\\rLonely Man of Faith that is listed under author\\'s name. All\\rbooks can be checked out for a maximum of two hours, but cannot be\\rchecked out of the library. The reading packet must be bought from the Religion Department on\\rthe second floor of Gest. This is a required text, and necessary for\\rcourse participation. Soloveitchik\\'s book presents a special case. It is very\\rexpensive, but very worth owning. I strongly recommend that you buy\\rthe book, but I do not require it due to its expense. The bookstore\\rhas ordered ten copies, and will order more if the need arises. There are two copies reserved in Magill library - one listed under\\rcall number, the other under author\\'s last name. If you choose not\\rto buy the book, I suggest that you copy pages from the library\\rreserve. All reading materials should be brought to class for the day\\rassigned. We will be doing a lot of critical readings of texts, so\\ryou really need that text in front of you in class. SYLLABUS I. CREATION 1. September 2 (Tuesday) Introduction to class Genesis 1 2.

Venegas Email: Armando.solorzano@utah.edu\\nPhone: (801) 803-8830 Office: Carlson Hall 112 Office Hours: Mon & Wed 10:45 12:00 PM Required text and readings: Books:\\nThe Chicano Studies Reader: An Anthology of Aztlan, 1970-2000 - Chon A. Noriega, Eric R. Avila, Karen Mary Davalos, and Chela Sandoval.\\nHarvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America - Juan Gonzalez. The Memories of Ana Caldern - Graciela Limon\\nOnline articles will be available on WebCT.\\nCourse Description:\\nThis class will introduce students to major socio-historical events that have shaped the experiences of Mexican Americans and Latinas/os (Chicanas/os) in the United States. Since the Chicano community is an ever-evolving phenomenon, we will put special emphasis on the continuous transformations of Mexican-American and Latina/o community, the causes, and its consequences. The relevance of Latinas/os in society lies not only in that they constitute the largest minority group in the United States, but also in their overwhelming contribution to political, social, and cultural arenas in American society. An interdisciplinary approach is employed in this course with literature drawn from Sociology, Political Science, History, Economics, and relevant videos. Course Goals:\\nUnderstanding that students learn in various ways, my approach to teaching is a multilateral one; I hope to create a safe and encouraging environment where students are encouraged to be open about their ideas and opinions without feeling marginalized. I understand that not two students are in the same level of comprehension of the topics discussed in class so I try to make the lectures and readings comprehensible enough for students located throughout the spectrum. I encourage students to challenge themselves to think outside the box and to become critical about the subject and their lives through the interactions with other students and with ideas which question normalized ideologies in society; to become trailblazers in their own right. Here are other goals set for class:\\nExpose students to elements which constitute to historical and contemporary Chicana/o identities. Develop analytical skills to interrogate how we construct and internalize forms of privileges and institutionalize individual and collective Chicana/o experiences. Provide opportunities for students to critically examine their own inherited political, economic, social, and cultural identities and how these shape how we see the world.\\nProvide students opportunities to intelligently connect course readings and assignments in the class and beyond.\\nBolster writing competencies that cross different disciplinary backgrounds. Academic Misconduct: Academic misconduct will not be tolerated and students will be penalized for cheating, plagiarism, and fabrication of information. Always remember to acknowledge any words or ideas which are not your own. When in doubt about how to reference your sources of information please ask the instructor.

This class incorporates social and political issues that intersect with race, class, gender, and sexual orientation.

There will be a series of brief written assignments (a total of about 15 pages for the semester). These must be typed, and are due at the beginning of class on the date indicated. The class Web Site--www.ets.uidaho.edu/mush440_540--includes the syllabus, assignments, related web sites, a class list with e-mail addresses, and a discussion function. Your class participation grade will be determined by attendance and evidence of preparation for a given days discussion and by your submissions to the discussion group on the Web. There will be two tests--on Monday March 8 and Monday April 26-- and a final summary project in lieu of a final exam. Assignments, participation, and tests are of equal weight (1/3 each) in determining your final grade There will be no class on the Friday of Jazz Festival.\\nGraduate Students: There will be one major project in addition to these listed requirements. RESOURCES\\nThree key reference tools for the study of American music are the New Grove Dictionary of American Music (in the Schuldt Library), David Horns The Literature of American Music and Donald Krummels Bibliographical Handbook of American Musicthese last two are bibliographies (classified lists of studies on all aspects of American music). Your text book, as well as the surveys of American music by Charles Hamm and H. Wiley Hitchcock, also have very useful bibliographies. UnCover and Academic Abstractson-line periodical searches through IDAare the best way to access current writings in newspapers and magazines on all subjects. The Music Index, the Humanities Index, and America, History and Life are useful periodical indexes to more in-depth articles in scholarly journals. The Schuldt Library has recordings and listening facilities, basic reference works, and a Reserve system. The catalogue to the CD collection is available on the computer across the room from the door; this catalogue is also available online: www.uidaho.edu/LS/Music/schuldt.html. LP\\'s are accessible through the card catalogue. The single most important source of recordings of U.S. music is the New World Records Recorded Anthology of American Musicyou have a Xerox of the first 100 records in the series. They are accessible in the library by asking for NW and then the number as listed in the handout. The Index to the New World Records by Davis ( Ref. ML 156.9/D38 in the U.I. Library) is a more complete analytical index. A few other key collections: A270-272--Anthology of American Folk Music; A203--The Folk Box; A381 The Smithsonian Collection of Country Music; cd 93-97 The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz, and The Smithsonian Collection of Classic American Song (a cassette collection with no number).\\nMy office hours are Wed. and Friday 9:30-10 and Thursday 1-2:30 PM.

      "[' pseudoscience01 FEB JUL APR 14 2005 2007 2009 6 captures\\n2 Sep 04 - 6 Apr 09 Close\\nHelp Pseudoscience: Why People Believe \"Weird\" Things.\\nWinter Quarter 2004 101 Section 235 (TTh 1:30-3:00) Instructor: George F. Michel, Psychology Department, Rm 507,\\nByrne Hall, ext. 54246\\ne-mail: gmichel@depaul.edu\\nOffice\\nhours: TTh 3:15-5:00, or by appointment\\nCourse Description: \"Pseudoscience: (Why People Believe \"Weird\"\\nThings)\" examines why superstitious behavior and weird beliefs are so prevalent,\\nhow they become established and are maintained, and how otherwise rational\\npeople come to believe in irrational phenomena.\\nReasons for Course: We live in the most technologically advanced\\nsociety in the most technologically advanced time in history. Yet, \"weird\"\\nbeliefs and superstitions are widespread. Many people believe in mind reading,\\npast-life regression therapy, abductions by extra-terrestrials, witches,\\nghosts, and other supernatural notions. Although science is the foundation\\nof modern technological achievements, many eschew real science in favor\\nof pseudoscience notions such as \"scientific creationism\", \"scientific\\nevidence of racial superiority\", \"UFOs and alien abductions\", \"alternative\\nmedicine\". Such supernatural beliefs are prevalent among people of all\\noccupations and every educational and income level. In this course, the\\nstudent examines several well-understood, psychological processes such\\nas, 1) our sensitivity to coincidence, 2) penchant for developing rituals\\nand habits to counteract feelings of anxiety or impatience when filling\\ntime or when marking expected changes in lifestyles, 3) a fear of failure,\\n4) attempts to cope with uncertainty, and 5) a need for control of our\\ndestinies that often result in irrational beliefs and superstitious and\\nerroneous behavior.\\nPurpose of Course: The purpose of this course is to enable the\\nstudent to discover exactly how superstitions, erroneous decisions, and\\nweird beliefs are a result of common cognitive processes invoked by attempts\\nto cope with the complexity and uncertainties of life (especially the social\\naspects of life). These cognitive processes are manifest in several different\\nkinds of strategies that are used in our intuitive reasoning. Some are\\nclose to good norms of rationality, whereas others depart sharply from\\nthem. Since the good and poor rational strategies co-exist, we are simultaneously\\nboth rational and irrational. The student is introduced to, and encouraged\\nto use, the methods of skepticism to counteract the twin alternate mental\\npositions of cynicism and gullibility that result from the typical application\\nof our intuitive cognitive processes as coping techniques.\\nCourse Design: The course begins first by describing our intuitive\\ncognitive processes. The student works through several examples which demonstrate\\nhow these processes contribute to fallacies of thinking. Then, alternative\\nmethods (e.g., decision analysis, problem-solving strategies, substituting\\nsmall meanings for \"the meaning of it all\", and learning how to delay gratification)\\nof coping with the complexity and uncertainty of life are presented. Finally,\\nseveral pseudoscientific notions (e.g., Scientific Creationism vs. Evolutionary\\nTheory, Evidence of Racial Superiority) are explored in greater detail\\n(using traditional written sources and those provided via the World Wide\\nWeb). Through individual and team projects, the student is encouraged to\\nprobe these beliefs for evidence of common fallacies of thinking and to\\nprovide\\nalternative methods for preventing and/or correcting the errors inherent\\nin acquiring these beliefs.\\nCourse Requirements: For each Thursday\\nclass meeting, the student is required to provide a written\\nreport (about a page) of an instance of belief or reasoning, encountered\\nin the media (TV, radio, newspapers, etc.) that is related to the current\\nor previous assigned readings (see syllabus). Each\\nTuesday of the week, the student will provide a written report\\n(about 650 words) of what he/she learned during the previous week.\\nThis report is not a brief summary of what was discussed\\nor read during the previous week but rather an account of\\nthose ideas, notions, or bits of information encountered in the readings\\nor discussion with which the student previously was unfamiliar or unaware.\\nWhen writing this paper, first describe exactly the information of which\\nyou were unaware or unfamiliar and then describe how it has changed your\\nunderstanding of science, pseudoscience, and reality. Students\\nwill keep a journal (about three entries/week) describing any\\ninstance in which course readings or discussion has helped them avoid confusing\\nscience with pseudoscience. The student also will maintain a personal portfolio\\nof his/her homework assignments. For a team project,\\nat the end of the quarter, the student will lead, with other members of\\nher/his team, a skeptical discussion of some form of \"weird\" belief (e.g.,\\nastrology, water dowsing, telepathy, spiritualism).

      "[' Crosscurrents, syllabus, Spring 2002 Sep OCT JAN 16 2002 2003 2004 5 captures\\n16 Oct 03 - 1 Sep 04 Close\\nHelp Crosscurrents\\nPassion Introduction Requirements Syllabus\\nReadings Class materials The Passion of the Holy Women\\nPerpetua and Felicitas\\n1.1 If ancient examples of faith, which were both evidence of the grace of God and things that assisted in the instruction of men, have been set down in writing so that by reading them and, as it were, by the representation of the actions themselves, God is honoured and man is comforted, why should not new examples which contribute equally to both ends also be disseminated? 1.2\\nAt some time in the future these examples themselves will be \\'ancient\\' and necessary for those times, even if in the present, in their own time, they are considered to have somewhat lesser authority because of the normal veneration of things that are old. 1.3\\nBut let those who adjudge the unique power of the one Holy Spirit to be limited to certain ages and times consider this: that more recent events should in fact be considered the greater since they are the most recent and because of the overflowing of grace decreed for the final expanses of time. 1.4\\nFor in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour my Spirit over all flesh, and their sons and daughters will prophesy; and I will pour forth my Spirit even over my slave men and slave women; and young men will see visions, and old men will dream dreams. 1.5\\nSo we also recognize and honour new prophesies and visions just as they have been promised, and all the other powers of the Holy Spirit that we believe to be for the use of the Church (to whom the Spirit has also been sent to manage the distribution of these gifts to everyone, just as the Lord distributes them to everyone). So it is necessary that we disseminate them and, by reading them, celebrate the glory of God, so that neither weakness nor despair of faith should lead anyone to believe that the grace of God was shared only by the ancients (whether it be the honour of martyrdom or of revelations) since God will always bring about what he has promised -- as evidence for those who do not believe, and as a favour for those who do. 1.6\\nAnd so let us also announce to you, our brothers and little sons, that which we have heard and have touched, so that you who are also interested in remembering the glory of the Lord might now know that though hearing you might have a partnership with the holy martyrs, and through them with our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is splendour and honour though the ages of ages. Amen. 2.1\\nThe young catechumens were arrested, Revocatus and his fellow female-slave Felicitas, and Saturninus and Secundulus. Among these persons was also Vibia Perpetua, a woman of honest birth, educated as befitting a person of free status, and properly married. 2.2\\nShe had a father, a mother, and two brothers, one of whom was a catechumen like herself, and a young infant son whom she was breastfeeding. 2.3\\nShe herself was about twenty-one years old. From this point on she narrates the whole sequence of events of her own martyrdom, just as she wrote it down in her own hand and according to her own understanding. She says: 3.1\\nWhen we were still with our arresting officers, my father wished to make me change my mind with words of persuasion. He perservered in his attempts to defeat me, all because of his love for me. \\'Father\\', I said, \\'For the sake of argument, do you see this vase, or whatever you want to call it, lying here?\\' And he said, \\'Yes, I see it\\'. 3.2\\nAnd I said to him, \\'Can you call it by any other name than what it is?\\' And he said, \\'No, you can\\'t\\'. \\'So,\\' I said, \\'I cannot call myself anything other than what I am -- a Christian\\'. 3.3\\nMerely hearing this word upset my father greatly. He threw himself at me with such violence that it seemed he wanted to tear my eyes out, but in the end he just harrassed me and then left, beaten, along with 3.4 his devilish arguments. For the next few days during which my father was away, I gave thanks to the Lord, and was able to refresh myself because of his absence. 3.5\\nIn the space of those few days I was baptized, and the Spirit told me not to expect anything else from the water except suffering in the flesh. A few days later we were thrown into prison. I was really frightened. I\\'d never experienced such darkness. 3.6\\nIt was a hard time. The heat was stifling because of overcrowding. The constant \\'shake-downs\\' and demands by the prison guards and soldiers. On top of everything, I was tortured with worry for my baby. 3.7\\nThen the blessed deacons Tertius and Pomponius, who brought help to us, paid out the necessary bribes -- and within a few hours we were sent to a better part of the prison where we were able to refresh ourselves. 3.8\\nWhen we left our prison quarters, we were all able to get some freedom for ourselves. I breastfed my baby. He was already faint from hunger. In my worry, I spoke to my mother about the baby, and tried to comfort my brother. I handed my baby boy over to their care. I was exhausted when I saw how worn out they were with concern for me. 3.9\\nThese worries tortured me for many days. Finally I got permission to keep my baby with me in prison. Once I had been relieved of the tortures and worries about my child, I immediately got better. The prison suddenly became a palace -- I would have preferred to be there rather than anywhere else in the world. 4.1 Then my brother said to me, \"Lady sister, you already have such an elevated standing that you can ask for a vision and it will be shown to you whether you are to suffer or to be set free.\" 4.2 And since I knew that I was able to talk with the Lord, whose favours I had shared so much, I faithfully promised this to him, saying, \"Tomorrow I will report back to you.\" I asked, and the following was shown to me. 4.3\\nI see a bronze ladder of great size reaching up to the sky, but narrow, so that only one person at a time could climb it, and on the sides of the ladder hung every type of iron instrument. There were swords, spears, curved hooks, knives, and sharp spits, so that if anyone tried to climb the ladder carelessly or did not pay attention while going up, they would be torn and their flesh would become hooked on the iron instruments. 4.4\\nAnd at the foot of the ladder itself there was coiled a snake of immense size, which would mount attacks on those who tried to climb the ladder and which would terrify them from making the attempt. 4.5\\nBut Saturus climbed up first -- he was the man who, although he was not present when we were arrested, later voluntarily handed himself over on our account (because he was the one who had taught us). 4.6\\nWhen he got to the top of the ladder, he turned around and said to me: \"Perpetua, I am supporting the ladder for you -- but watch that the snake doesn\\'t bite you.\" And I said, \"In the name of Jesus Christ, it will not harm me.\" 4.7\\nAnd, as if it were afraid of me, it stuck its head out only warily from beneath the foot of the ladder. And, as if I were stepping on the first rung of a ladder, I stepped on its head and began my climb. 4.8\\nAnd I saw the immense expanse of a garden and in the middle there sat a white-haired man in the clothing of a shepherd, a large man, milking his sheep. And standing about were a many thousands clad in shining white robes. 4.9\\nAnd he raised his head, noticed me and said: \"It is good that you have come, my child.\" And he called me over and from the cheese that he had milked he gave me a little mouthful. And I took it in my cupped hands and ate it. And all those who were standing round about said, \"Amen\". 4.10\\nAnd at the sound of their voice I woke up, still chewing something sweet. And I immediately reported all of this to my brother. And I understood that I was to suffer and I began to have no more hope for this earthly life. 5.1\\nA few days later a rumour began to circulate that we were to be taken to our court hearing. My father, consumed with worry, hurried from the city. He came to me in order to dissuade me, and said: 5.2\\n\"My daughter, have pity on my grey hair. Have pity on your father, if I am still worthy to be called \\'father\\' by you. With these hands of mine I raised you to the flower of your present age. I placed you before all your brothers in honour. Please don\\'t shame me before other men. 5.3\\nConsider your brothers. Consider your mother and your mother\\'s sister. Think of your baby son, who will not be able to live without you. 5.4\\nChange you mind before you destroy us all. If anything should happen to you, none of us will be able to speak freely again.\" 5.5\\nMy father spoke these words to me, as a father would, with paternal affection, kissing my hands. Throwing himself at my feet, he wept. He no longer addressed me as \\'daughter\\', but rather as \\'Lady.\\' 5.6\\nFor my part, I grieved for my father\\'s misfortune, because he alone of all my relations took no joy in my suffering. I tried to comfort him, and said, \"What happens tomorrow on the prisoners\\' platform will be what God wishes. You must know that we are no longer in our own power, but in that of God.\" He went away from me deeply saddened. 6.1\\nOn the next day, when we were eating breakfast, we were suddenly seized to be taken to our court hearing. We came to the forum. Rumour had quickly run through the parts of the town neighbouring on the forum, and an immense crowd began to gather. 6.2\\nWe ascended the platform. The others, when questioned, confessed. Then my turn came. My father appeared right there with my baby son He pulled me down off the stairs, and said, \"Sacrifice. Have pity on your child.\" 6.3\\nAnd Hilarianus the procurator, who was then acting (governor) in place of the deceased proconsul Mincius Timinianus, and who had received the governor\\'s \\'right of the sword\\', said: \"Spare the white hair of your father, spare your infant son. Make sacrifice on behalf of the Health of our Lord Emperors.\" 6.4\\nAnd I said, \"I will not.\" Hilarianus then asked: \"Are you a Christian?\" And I replied, \"I am a Christian.\" 6.5\\nAnd when my father rushed up in order to dissuade me, Hilarianus ordered him to be struck down and to be beaten with rods. And the fate of my father made me grieve as if I myself were being beaten. Thus I grieved for his old age. 6.6\\nThen the governor pronounced his sentence against us all and condemned us to the beasts. We descended the platform and returned, happy, to the prison. 6.7\\nBut because my baby had become used to being breastfed and to staying with me in prison, I immediately sent the deacon Pomponius to my father to ask him to return my baby to me. My father refused. It was as God willed. The baby no longer desired my breasts. They were no longer to be so sore and inflamed. I was no longer tortured with concern for my baby, or by the pain in my breasts. 7.1\\nA few days later we were all praying. Suddenly, in the midst of prayer, a voice came to me and I called out the name of Dinocrates. And I was shocked because his name had never entered my mind except at that moment, and I became very sad when I remembered his fate. 7.2\\nAnd I knew at once that I was full of honour and had to make a request on his behalf. And I began to make a long prayer on his behalf and to groan out aloud to the Lord. 7.3\\nOn that very same night, the following was shown to me: 7.4\\nI see Dinocrates coming out of a shadowy place where there are many other persons -- he is very hot and dry, his clothes filthy and his colour pale. And there is that wound on his face, which he had when he died. 7.5\\nThis Dinocrates was my brother in the flesh, six years old, who, because of his weak state, had died from a cancer of the face -- a death so terrible that it was hateful to all those who witnessed it. 7.6\\nTherefore I prayed on his behalf. But between him and me there was a great chasm so that neither one of us could approach the other. 7.7\\nIn that place, where Dinocrates was, there was a reservoir full of water, but it had a rim higher than the height of the boy; and Dinocrates always had to try to stretch himself upwards in order to get a drink. 7.8\\nI was pained because the reservoir was full of water, but Dinocrates was not able to get a drink because of the height of the rim. 7.9\\nThen, suddenly, I woke up and I realized that my brother was suffering. But I had faith that I would be able to assist him. On every day we spent in the military prison, I kept praying on his behalf. For we were to fight in the military games. At this time it was the anniversary (birthday) of Geta Caesar. 7.10\\nAnd I prayed on his behalf day and night, groaning and crying that this gift might be given to me. 8.1\\nOn the day on which we were kept in bonds, the following was shown to me: I see that place where I had earlier seen Dinocrates, but he now has a clean body, is well clothed and refreshed; and where there was once a wound, I now see a scar. 8.2\\nAnd that reservoir, which I had seen earlier, has its rim lowered to the level of the boy\\'s navel, and he is drawing water from it without cease. 8.3\\nAnd on rim there is a golden dish full of water. And Dinocrates comes near to it and begins to drink from it; and that dish never ran dry. 8.4\\nAnd when he was full, he goes away from the water and begins to play happily in the usual manner of children. And suddenly I woke up. Then I realized that he had been removed from his punishment. 9.1\\nThen, a few days later, the soldier, the \\'officer\\' (optio) Pudens, who was in charge of the prison, began to praise us realizing what great courage there was in us. He allowed many people to visit us so that, in turns, we and they were able to refresh ourselves. 9.2\\nAs the day of the games was now coming near, my father came to me consumed with worry, and he began to pull out the hairs of his beard and to throw them on the ground, and he then threw himself prostrate on the ground before me, and began to curse the number of his years, and to utter such words as would move all creation. 9.3\\nAnd I grieved for his unhappy old age. 10.1\\nOn the day before we were to fight, I see in the following vision: The deacon Pomponius came to the door of the prison and beat on it loudly. 10.2\\nAnd I went out to him and opened the door for him. He was clothed in an unbelted shining white garment, and was wearing multilayered sandals. 10.3\\nAnd he said to me, \"Perpetua, we are waiting for you -- come.\" And he held my hand and we began to go through some very harsh and rugged country. 10.4\\nWe had hardly arrived, out of breath, at the amphitheater when he led me into the middle of the arena and said to me: \"Don\\'t be afraid. I am with you here and will struggle with you.\" And he went away. 10.5\\nAnd I notice the huge roaring crowd. Because I knew that I had been sentenced to the beasts, I was surprised that no wild animals were being sent out against me. 10.6\\nInstead there came out against me an Egyptian, disgusting in appearance, along with his assistants to fight with me. And there come to me some handsome young men, and my assistants and supporters. 10.7\\nI am undressed and become a man. And my assistants began to rub me all over with olive oil, as is customary in such athletic contests. And on the other side I see the Egyptian rolling around in the dust. 10.8\\nAnd there came out a man of great size so that he even exceeded the roof of the amphitheater in height, dressed in an unbelted cloak coloured purple between two stripes that ran down the middle of his chest, wearing multi-layered sandals made from gold and silver, carrying a baton somewhat like a lanista (gladiatorial trainer), and holding a green branch on which there were golden apples. 10.9\\nAnd he asked for silence, and said, \"This Egyptian, if he beats this woman, will kill her with his sword; this woman, if she beats him, will receive this branch. 10.10\\nAnd he went back to his seat. And we advanced towards each other and began to exchange blows. The Egyptian wanted to be able to grab me by the feet, but I was able to keep striking him in the face with my heels. 10.11\\nAnd I was raised up in the air and I began to strike him in this way even though I was not able to step on the ground. But when I saw there was a delay in his reactions, I joined my hands by knitting my fingers together and grabbed hold of his head. He fell on his face and I stepped on his head. 10.12\\nAnd the crowd began to shout and my supporters began to sing songs in my praise. And I went up to the lanista and received the branch. 10.13\\nAnd he kissed me and said to me, \"Daughter, peace be with you. And I began to leave the arena through the Gate of Life, covered with glory. Then, suddenly, I woke up. 10.14\\nAnd I realized that I was not about to do battle with the beasts, but against the devil. But I also knew that I was to be victorious. 10.15\\nI have written my account up to the day before the games. What happens at the games themselves, let him write who wishes to do so. 11.1\\nBut the blessed Saturus also issued this vision of his own, which he himself wrote down. He said: 11.2\\nWe had died and had departed from our flesh, and we began to be carried by four angels towards the east, angels whose hands did not touch ours. 11.3\\nWe were indeed moving, not lying down and turned upwards, but as if climbing a gentle slope. 11.4\\nAnd as soon as we were freed from this world, we saw an immense light, and I said to Perpetua (for she was at my side): \\'This is what the Lord promised us. We have received his promise.\\' 11.5\\nAnd while we were being guided along by these four angels, a great open space appeared to us, which was much like a formal garden, having rose bushes and every kind of flower. 11.6\\nThe height of the trees was the same as that of a cypress, and their leaves kept falling all the time. 11.7\\nIn that garden there were four more angels, more resplendent than the others, who, when they saw us, honoured us, and said to the other angels, in admiration: \"Here they are, here they are!\" And those four angels who had guided us became fearful, and so they set us down. 11.8\\nAnd on foot we crossed to a stadium by a broad road. 11.9\\nThere we found Iucundus and Saturninus and Artaxius, who had been burned alive in the same persecution, and Quintus, who had died as a martyr while still in prison, and we asked of them where they had been. 11.10\\nBut the other angels said to us, \\'First come, enter, and greet the Lord.\\' 12.1\\nAnd we came to a place whose walls seemed to be constructed from light; and in front of the doorway of this place stood four angels, who clothed those who entered in long shining white robes. 12.2\\nAnd we entered, and we heard a single united voice saying \\'Holy, Holy, Holy, \\' without cease. 12.3\\nAnd we saw in that same place a sort of white-haired man sitting down who had snowy white hair and the face of a young man, but whose feet we could not see. 12.4\\nTo his right and to his left stood four elders, and behind them stood many other elders. 12.5\\nAnd entering with a sense of wonder we stood before the throne, and four angels raised us up and we kissed him, and he stretched out his hand and touched us on the face. 12.6\\nAnd some elders said to us: \\'Let us stand.\\' And so we stood and made the greeting of peace. And other elders said to us, \\'Get up and play.\\' 12.7\\nAnd I said to Perpetua, \\'You now have what you want.\\' And she said to me, \\'Thanks be to God. As I was once happy in the flesh, I am now much happier in this existence.\\' 13.1\\nAnd then we went out, and we saw outside the gate the bishop Optatus on the right and the learned presbyter Aspasius to the left, both looking rather sad and lonely. 13.2\\nAnd they threw themselves at our feet and said, \\'Let us make up matters between us, since you have gone away, and have left us here alone.\\' 13.3\\nAnd we said to them, \\'Are you not our father and you our priest, and yet you are throwing yourselves at our feet?\\' And we were greatly moved and we embraced them. 13.4\\nAnd Perpetua began to speak in Greek with them, and we went apart with them into the garden, beneath the rose trees. 13.5\\nAnd when we were speaking with them, the angels said to them, \\'Allow these people to refresh themselves. And if you have any quarrels amongst yourselves, then settle them amongst yourselves.\\' 13.6\\nAnd the angels greatly upset them. They said to Optatus, \\'Correct your congregation, because they are coming to you as if they were returning from the chariot races and from fighting over the different teams.\\' 13.7\\nAnd thus it seemed to us that they wished to close the gates. 13.8\\nAnd we began to recognize many brothers there and also martyrs, and we were all nourished on an ineffable fragrance which filled us to the full. Thus, rejoicing, I woke up. 14.1\\nThese are the remarkable visions of those most blessed martyrs, Saturus and Perpetua, which they themselves wrote down. 14.2\\nAs for Secundulus, indeed, God called him out from this world by a premature death, while he was still in prison. It was a special favour so that he would be spared from facing the wild beasts. 15.1\\nAs for Felicitas, indeed, the favour of the Lord also touched her in this way. 15.2\\nShe already had an unborn child in her womb for eight months (for she was pregnant when she was arrested). When the day of the spectacle was upon them, she was in great sorrow lest her appearance be put off because of her pregnancy -- for it was not permitted to display pregnant women in public punishments. She feared that she would have to pour out her holy and innocent blood in a later show amongst the guilty common criminals. 15.3\\nEven her fellow martyrs were greatly saddened lest they leave behind such a good companion, a lone comrade to take the same road of hope. 15.4\\nJoined together, therefore, with one groan they pour out a prayer to the Lord on the second day before the games. 15.5\\nImmediately after their prayer, the birth pains began to overwhelm her. And since she suffered greatly in her labour because of the natural difficulty of giving birth in the eighth month, one of the assistant jailers said to her, \"If you are suffering this much with this, what will you do when thrown to the beasts, whom you thought so little of when you refused to sacrifice?\" 15.6\\nAnd she replied, \"Now I am suffering what I am suffering; but there there will be another in me who will suffer for me, because I will be suffering for him\". 15.7\\nThus she gave birth to a baby girl, whom a certain sister raised for her as her own daughter. 16.1\\nTherefore since the Holy Spirit has permitted and in giving permission has so wished it, I have written down the sequence of events in the games themselves. Even if we are unworthy to add to such great glory by our simple narrative, nevertheless since it was the mandate (mandatum) of the most holy Perpetua, we shall execute her trust (fideicommissum), adding one more document concerning her resolve and her nobility of mind. 16.2\\nThe tribune had punished them severely. Because of the warnings of certain very hollow men he was afraid that they be would be whisked out of prison by the use of certain magical incantations. Perpetua addressed him to his face: 16.3\\n\"Why do you not allow us to refresh ourselves at all, we the most noble of the condemned, indeed of Caesar\\'s, since we are intended to fight on his birthday? Will there not in fact be glory for you, if we are brought forth looking fatter on that day?\" 16.4\\nThe tribune was very upset and blushed. He ordered them to be treated more humanely and he gave the opportunity for her brothers and for others to come and and to be refreshed with them, for by this time even the officer (optio) of the prison was a believer. 17.1\\nOn the day before the games they ate the last supper which they call \\'the free.\\' For them, however, it was not a \\'free dinner\\', but rather a \\'love feast.\\' And with that same resolve they hurled words back at the crowd, threatening them with the coming judgment of God. Giving common witness to the happiness they had in their own suffering, they ridiculed the curiosity of the voyeurs. Saturus said: 17.2\\n\"Will not tomorrow be enough for you? Why do you stare so eagerly at what you hate? Today our friends, tomorrow our enemies. But carefully note our faces, so that you will be able to recognize us on that day.\" 17.3\\nSo all the onlookers were thunderstruck, retreated, and from these experiences many of them began to believe. 18.1\\nThe day of their victory dawned. They processed from the prison into the amphitheater, happy, as if they were going to heaven, shaking, not with fear, but with joy. 18.2\\nPerpetua followed, with a shining face, a calm step, as the wife of Christ and the girlfriend of God, rejecting the gaze of all the onlookers with the strength of her own eyes. 18.3\\nLikewise Felicitas, was joyful that she had given birth safely, so that she might do battle with the wild animals, from blood to blood, from the midwife to the net-man gladiator (retarius), washed after giving birth in a second baptism. 18.4\\nAnd when they were lead to the gate of the arena, they were forced to put on new clothing, the men that of the priests of Saturn, the women that of the priestesses of Ceres. It was then that that kind woman fought back right to the end with her usual resolve. 18.5\\nShe said, \"We came to this place freely, of our own volition, so that our freedom would not be taken away. We pledged lives, so that we would not be required to do anything else. That is the agreement we made with you.\" 18.6\\nEven injustice recognizes justice. The tribune conceded. They would be led forth into the arena dressed plainly, just as they were. 18.7\\nPerpetua sand a song, already treading on the head of the Egyptian. Revocatus, Saturninus and Saturus began to issue threats at the onlooking crowd. 18.8\\nThen, when they came beneath the gaze of Hilarianus, by gestures and motions they indicated to Hilarianus \"You -- us, but God -- you.\" 18.9\\nThe crowd became very agitated at this and demanded that they be whipped through a line of beast-hunting gladiators. But all the martyrs were happy because they were now able to have a share in the Lord\\'s sufferings. 19.1\\nBut he who said, \"Ask and you will receive\", granted to each one of those who asked the death which that one desired. 19.2\\nFor, when they used to talk amongst themselves concerning the wish they had for their type of martyrdom, Saturninus declared that he wished to be thrown before every different type of wild beast so that he would be able to acquire a more glorious crown. 19.3\\nSo, in the staging of the spectacle, he and Revocatus, having first experienced the attack of a leopard, were then put on a platform where they were attacked by a bear. 19.4\\nSaturus, however, was terrified most by the thought of bears. He hoped that he would be finished off by one bite from a leopard. 19.5\\nHe was exposed to a wild boar, but it was the venator who had tied him to the boar who was actually gored by the animal and died a few days after the games. Saturus himself was only dragged along. 19.6\\nAnd when he was exposed to a bear, having been trussed up on the bridge, the bear refused to come out of its cage. So, still unharmed, Saturus was taken away. 20.1\\nThe devil, however, was preparing a wild cow for the women, an unusual and uncustomary thing. A wild animal to match their sex. 20.2\\nUnclothed and clad only in see-through nets, the women were brought forth. The crowd, however, was very upset, seeing the one woman was a delicate young girl, and the other, her breasts still dripping with milk, fresh from childbirth. 20.3\\nSo the women were taken away, and were clothed in unbelted robes. Perpetua was hit first and fell on her side. 20.4\\nWhen she sat down, Perpetua drew back the robe which had been torn along one side in order to drape her thighs, more mindful of shame than of pain. 20.5\\nThen she fixed up her hair, which had become dishevelled, with a sharp pin. It was, indeed, not right that a female martyr should suffer while her hair was out of order, so that she might actually appear to be mourning while actually in her glory. 20.6\\nThen she got up and noticed Felicitas who had been crushed to the ground. She went over to her, stretched out her hand and helped her get up. Then the two of them stood together. 20.7\\nThe hardness of the crowd was now finally overcome, and so the women were taken back through the Gate of Life. 20.8\\nThere Perpetua was held up by a certain catechumen named Rusticus who had been close by her side, and, almost as if coming out of a dream (so much had she been imbued in the spirit and in ecstasy) she began to look around and to all those who were there, and who were much taken aback, she said, \"When are we going to be exposed to that wild cow, or whatever it is?\" 20.9\\nAnd when she heard what had already happened, she could not believe it at first, except that she saw the marks of the physical violence on her body and on her clothing. 20.10\\nThen she summoned her brother and the catechumen, and spoke to them, saying, \"Remain strong in the faith and all love each other; do not be panicked by our sufferings\". 21.1\\nLikewise, at another gate, Saturus was exhorting the soldier Pudens, saying, \"As things stand now, it is exactly as I presumed and predicted -- I have not yet even felt the attack of one wild beast. Now believe me with all your heart. See, I will be exposed to that animal, and will be finished off by one bite of a leopard.\" 21.2\\nAnd at the end of the spectacle, he was thrown to a leopard. At one bit from the animal so much blood gushed out that the crowd roared in witness to his second baptism: \"Had a great bath! Had a great bath!\" 21.3\\nFor he was certainly well who had been washed in this way. 21.4\\nThen he said to the soldier Pudens, \"Farewell. Remember my faith and me. Don\\'t let these things upset you. Let them strengthen you.\" 21.5\\nAt the same time he asked him for a ring from his finger, and dipping it in his wound, he gave it back to him as an inheritance, leaving this pledge and memorial of his blood to him. 21.6\\nBy then, as he was unconscious, his body was thrown in the usual place, along with the others, to have his throat cut. 21.7\\nBut the crowd demanded that they be brought back into the middle of the arena, so that, when the sword penetrated into the bodies, their eyes could be companions to the slaughter. The condemned then got up of their own accord and took themselves to the place where the crowd wanted them, exchanged kisses with each other, and so sealed their martyrdom with the ritualistic signs of peace. 21.8\\nThe others, without moving and in silence, received the sword, especially Saturus, who was the first to ascend the platform, and the first to give up his spirit. For he was there to sustain Perpetua. 21.9\\nPerpetua, however, had to taste more pain yet. She screamed out in agony as she was struck on the bone. She herself had to steady the wavering right hand of a rookie gladiator and guide it to her throat. 21.10\\nPerhaps such a great woman, who was so feared by the unclean spirit, could not be killed unless she herself willed it. 21.11\\nO bravest and most blessed martyrs. You are truly called and chosen for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Anyone who praises and honours and adores him ought to read these proofs, which are no less important than the ancient ones for the strengthening of the Church. These new examples of courage will give witness to the one and always the same Holy Spirit who works amongst us even up to the present day. And to almighty God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, to whom is splendour and boundless power through the ages of ages. Amen. ']\n",

I. CALL TO ORDER\\nChair Gilbert called the meeting to order at 11:33 a.m. II. URGENT BUSINESS\\nNone. III. ANNOUNCEMENTS\\nChair Gilbert announced the sad news that Judy Ramirezs husband, Frank, passed away on November 13th. Condolences may be sent to Judy Ramirez, 2066 Picasso Drive, Davis, CA 95618. In lieu of flowers, contributions in memory of Frank may be made to the Child & Adolescent Studies Endowment Fund. He also announced receiving a notification a week ago of a volume that the CSU Institute for Teaching & Learning is putting together relating to issues on academic technology in the CSU. They are looking to identify published articles written by faculty from all the campuses, who have effectively integrated academic technology into their teaching. They encourage papers that address the use of technology to improve student learning or student access to learning, but will accept any article that was written or co-authored by CSU faculty members that addresses the use of academic technology in higher education. Submission deadline is Friday, December 6, 2002. Chair Gilbert noted he had received a notification from David Spence concerning an international faculty partnership seminar that will be held this summer in Paris. Title of the seminar is Imagine Real Spaces: France and California. Seminar theme will examine the worlds perception of Paris and California as places of dreams. The group will also explore leading geopolitical roles each plays and how it highlights the contrasts between dream and reality. Substantial amounts of the costs of attending are being picked up by the Chancellors office, and local campuses are encouraged to help out with travel costs. If interested in applying for the seminar, brochures are available in the Senate office or in the International Programs Office. Senator Nanjundappa announced the 2003-04 Contract Re-Opener Bargaining Survey Luncheon Meeting scheduled to be held on Monday, December 9th at 12 noon. Senator Rhotencommented on the materials she distributed to Senatorsfrom the Academic Integritycampaignsponsored by the Dean of StudentsOffice, Judicial Affairsand University Honors and Scholars throughUniversity Initiative funding. The aimof the campaign is to help students understand academic integrity expectations withinthe universitycommunity. They worked withan advisory group of studentsfrom across the colleges whocame up withthe theme, CSUF-Making Integrity Count, and helped produce four different posters aimed at students to help them do the right thing. The campaignwas kicked off in late October at an HonorsWeek event andthey will be out at otherstudent events throughout the rest of theacademic year. Senator Pasternack announced he had attended the statewide Senate meeting last week. A major item of discussion on Friday was a Senate resolution calling for reconsideration of the Trustees proposed budget. The budget proposal adopted by the Board of Trustees is inconsistent with Senate budget priorities in that it: Provides for only 1% faculty salary increase within the partnership agreement; Seeks funding for salary costs already funded under previous legislative allocations; Sets the interests of faculty and university staff against each other through an attempt to achieve salary parity; Fails to cover first-year costs of ACR-73 in the partnership agreement. Senator Meyer explained that a major source of frustration for the faculty is that over the last 7 or 8 years, the system has received from the legislature exactly what the trustees have asked for. We have not asked for monies to help with the closing of CPEC salary gap, or money for taking care of burdening maintenance. We are not going to get additional funding from the State of California unless we ask for it, and for whatever reason, the Chancellor and Trustees have decided that they will not ask for it. Predictions for next years budget include a cut estimated to be between 12 to 15%. IV. CHAIRS REPORT\\nChair Gilbert reminded the Senators that the discussion of the proposal to raise CSUFs enrollment cap to 25,000, as part of the revised Master Plan, will be on the agenda for the next Senate meeting on December 12th. In order to create a context in which we can have an informed, collegial and constructive discussion of that issue, he encouraged the Senators to communicate to the Senate office any questions, concerns or issues that they would like to raise at that meeting, so that the individuals who will be in a position to respond to those issues, can do so as responsibly and comprehensively as possible.

Moody\\nHCC Policy Statement - ADA\\nAny student with a documented disability (e.g. physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, etc.) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodations must contact the Disability Services Office at the respective college at the beginning of each semester. Faculty is authorized\\nto provide only the accommodations requested by the Disability Support\\nServices Office. For questions, please contact Donna Price at 713.718.5165 or the Disability\\nCounselor at your college. To visit the ADA Web site, please visit\\nwww.hccs.edu then click Future students, scroll down the page and click on\\nthe words Disability Information.

The instructor is responsible for measuring each student\\'s individual achievements and also for ensuring that all students compete on a level playing field. Thus, in our system, the instructor has teaching, grading, and enforcement roles. You are expected to be familiar with the University\\'s Policy on Academic Honesty, found in the catalog. What that means is: If you are charged with an offense, pleading ignorance of the rules will not help you. Students are responsible for conducting themselves with honor and integrity in fulfilling course requirements. Penalties and/or disciplinary proceedings may be initiated by College System officials against a student accused of scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty: includes, but is not limited to, cheating on a test, plagiarism, and collusion. Cheating on a test includes: Copying from another students test paper; Using materials not authorized by the person giving the test; Collaborating with another student during a test without authorization; Knowingly using, buying, selling, stealing, transporting, or soliciting in whole or part the contents of a test that has not been administered; Bribing another person to obtain a test that is to be administered. Plagiarism means the appropriation of anothers work and the unacknowledged incorporation of that work in ones own written work offered for credit. Collusion mean the unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing written work offered for credit. Possible punishments for academic dishonesty may include a grade of 0 or F in the particular assignment, failure in the course, and/or recommendation for probation or dismissal from the College System. (See the Student Handbook) HCC Policy Statements Class Attendance - It is important that you come to class! Attending class regularly is the best way to succeed in this class. Research has shown that the single most important factor in student success is attendance. Simply put, going to class greatly increases your ability to succeed. You are expected to attend all lecture and labs regularly. You are responsible for materials covered during your absences. Class attendance is checked daily. Although it is your responsibility to drop a course for nonattendance, the instructor has the authority to drop you for excessive absences. If you are not attending class, you are not learning the information. As the information that is discussed in class is important for your career, students may be dropped from a course after accumulating absences in excess of six (6) hours of instruction. The six hours of class time would include any total classes missed or for excessive tardiness or leaving class early. You may decide NOT to come to class for whatever reason. As an adult making the decision not to attend, you do not have to notify the instructor prior to missing a class. However, if this happens too many times, you may suddenly find that you have lost the class. Poor attendance records tend to correlate with poor grades. If you miss any class, including the first week, you are responsible for all material missed. It is a good idea to find a friend or a buddy in class who would be willing to share class notes or discussion or be able to hand in paper if you unavoidably miss a class. Class attendance equals class success. HCC Course Withdrawal Policy\\nIf you feel that you cannot complete this course, you will need to withdraw from the course prior to the final date of withdrawal. Before, you withdraw from your course; please take the time to meet with the instructor to discuss why you feel it is necessary to do so. The instructor may be able to provide you with suggestions that would enable you to complete the course. Your success is very important. Beginning in fall 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a law limiting first time entering freshmen to no more than SIX total course withdrawals throughout their educational career in obtaining a certificate and/or degree. To help students avoid having to drop/withdraw from any class, HCC has instituted an Early Alert process by which your professor may alert you and HCC counselors that you might fail a class because of excessive absences and/or poor academic performance. It is your responsibility to visit with your professor or a counselor to learn about what, if any, HCC interventions might be available to assist you online tutoring, child care, financial aid, job placement, etc. to stay in class and improve your academic performance. If you plan on withdrawing from your class, you MUST contact a HCC counselor or your professor prior to withdrawing (dropping) the class for approval and this must be done PRIOR to the withdrawal deadline to receive a W on your transcript. **Final withdrawal deadlines vary each semester and/or depending on class length, please visit the online registration calendars, HCC schedule of classes and catalog, any HCC Registration Office, or any HCC counselor to determine class withdrawal deadlines. Remember to allow a 24-hour response time when communicating via email and/or telephone with a professor and/or counselor. Do not submit a request to discuss withdrawal options less than a day before the deadline. If you do not withdraw before the deadline, you will receive the grade that you are making in the class as your final grade. Repeat Course Fee\\nThe State of Texas encourages students to complete college without having to repeat failed classes. To increase student success, students who repeat the same course more than twice, are required to pay extra tuition. The purpose of this extra tuition fee is to encourage students to pass their courses and to graduate. Effective fall 2006, HCC will charge a higher tuition rate to students registering the third or subsequent time for a course. If you are considering course withdrawal because you are not earning passing grades, confer with your instructor/counselor as early as possible about your study habits, reading and writing homework, test taking skills, attendance, course participation, and opportunities for tutoring or other assistance that might be available. Classroom Behavior\\nAs your instructor and as a student in this class, it is our shared responsibility to develop and maintain a positive learning environment for everyone. Your instructor takes this responsibility very seriously and will inform members of the class if their behavior makes it difficult for him/her to carry out this task. As a fellow learner, you are asked to respect the learning needs of your classmates and assist your instructor achieve this critical goal. Use of Camera and/or Recording Devices\\nAs a student active in the learning community of this course, it is your responsibility to be respectful of the learning atmosphere in your classroom. To show respect of your fellow students and instructor, you will turn off your phone and other electronic devices, and will not use these devices in the classroom unless you receive permission from the instructor. Use of recording devices, including camera phones and tape recorders, is prohibited in classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, and other locations where instruction, tutoring, or testing occurs. Students with disabilities who need to use a recording device as a reasonable accommodation should contact the Office for Students with Disabilities for information regarding reasonable accommodations\\nInstructor Requirements\\nAs your Instructor, it is my responsibility to:\\nProvide the grading scale and detailed grading formula explaining how student grades are to be derived Facilitate an effective learning environment through class activities, discussions, and lectures Description of any special projects or assignments Inform students of policies such as attendance, withdrawal, tardiness and make up Provide the course outline and class calendar which will include a description of any special projects or assignments Arrange to meet with individual students before and after class as required To be successful in this class, it is the students responsibility to:\\nAttend class and participate in class discussions and activities Read and comprehend the textbook Complete the required assignments and exams:\\nAsk for help when there is a question or problem Keep copies of all paperwork, including this syllabus, handouts and all assignments Grading\\nYour instructor will conduct quizzes, exams, and assessments that you can use to determine how successful you are at achieving the course learning outcomes (mastery of course content and skills) outlined in the syllabus. If you find you are not mastering the material and skills, you are encouraged to reflect on how you study and prepare for each class. Your instructor welcomes a dialogue on what you discover and may be able to assist you in finding resources on campus that will improve your performance.\\nFinal grades are determined by averaging the total of each area listed below. 30% Instructors Choice (Online activities, quizzes, attendance/orientation & assignments) 10% Assignment Portfolio 15% Midterm Exam 25% Career Research Essay and Oral Presentation 20% Final Exam Grading Scale: 90-100 A 80-89 B 70-79 C 69-60 D 59 and Below F Useful Web Resources:\\nwww.hccs.edu\\nhttp HYPERLINK \"http://learning.nwc.hccs.edu/\" ://learning.hccs.edu http:// HYPERLINK \"http://careers.typefocus.com/index.html\" careers.typefocus.com/index.html www.bls.gov/OCO/ www.tbecachievetexas.com\\nwww.hccs.askonline.net\\nhttp://mystudentsuccesslab.com\\nwww.acinet.org Please have the names and telephone numbers of two students you may call.

By the end of ENGL 1302, students should be able to:\\nRhetorical Knowledge\\nIdentify and analyze the components and complexities of a rhetorical situation\\nUse knowledge of audience, exigence, constraints, genre, tone, diction, syntax, and structure to produce situation-appropriate argumentative texts, including texts that move beyond formulaic structures\\nKnow and use special terminology for analyzing and producing arguments\\nPractice and analyze informal logic as used in argumentative texts Critical Reading, Thinking, and Writing\\nUnderstand the interactions among critical thinking, critical reading, and writing\\nIntegrate personal experiences, values, and beliefs into larger social conversations and contexts\\nFind, evaluate, and analyze primary and secondary sources for appropriateness, timeliness, and validity\\nProduce situation-appropriate argumentative texts that synthesize sources with their own ideas and advance the conversation on an important issue\\nProvide valid, reliable, and appropriate support for claims, and analyze evidentiary support in others texts Processes\\nPractice flexible strategies for generating, revising, and editing complex argumentative texts\\nEngage in all stages of advanced, independent library research\\nPractice writing as a recursive process that can lead to substantive changes in ideas, structure, and supporting evidence through multiple revisions\\nUse the collaborative and social aspects of writing to critique their own and others arguments Conventions\\nApply and develop knowledge of genre conventions ranging from structure and paragraphing to tone and mechanics, and be aware of the field-specific nature of these conventions\\nSummarize, paraphrase, and quote from sources using appropriate documentation style\\nRevise for style and edit for features such as syntax, grammar, punctuation, and spelling\\nEmploy technologies to format texts according to appropriate stylistic conventions Required Texts.\\nGraff and Birkenstein, They Say/I Say 2nd edition\\nFirst-Year Writing: Perspectives on Argument (2012 UTA custom 3rd edition STUDENTS MUST HAVE THIS EDITION)\\nRuszkiewicz et al, The Scott, Foresman Writer (UTA custom edition) Description of Major Assignments. Reading Responses/Reading Quizzes: Each reading response should be two double-spaced pages and should address the prompts provided. Reading quizzes will be assigned periodically, particularly if students do not come to class prepared. Issue Proposal: This semester youll be conducting research on an issue that you select. For this paper, you will take stock of what you already know about the issue you select, organize and develop your thoughts, and sketch a plan for your research. Annotated Bibliography: For this assignment you will create a list of at least 10 relevant sources that represent multiple perspectives on your issue. You will include a summary of each source and a discussion of how you might use the source in your next essays. Mapping the Issue: For this paper, you will map the controversy surrounding your issue by describing its history and summarizing at least three different positions on the issueall from a completely neutral point of view. Researched Position Paper: For this paper, you will advocate a position on your issue with a well-supported argument written for an audience that you select.\\nPeer Reviews. Each essay will include mandatory peer review workshops. You will be required to include all peer review materials in the papers final folder in order to receive full credit. It is very important that you attend class on peer review days, as you will not be able to make up these points. Grades. Grades in FYC are A, B, C, F, and Z. Students must pass ENGL 1301 and ENGL 1302 with a grade of C or higher in order to move on to the next course. This policy is in place because of the key role that First-Year English courses play in students educational experiences at UTA. The Z grade is reserved for students who attend class regularly, participate actively, and complete all the assigned work on time but simply fail to write well enough to earn a passing grade. This judgment is made by the instructor and not necessarily based upon a number average. The Z grade is intended to reward students for good effort. While students who receive a Z will not get credit for the course, the Z grade will not affect their grade point average. They may repeat the course for credit until they do earn a passing grade. The F grade, which does negatively affect GPA, goes to failing students who do not attend class regularly, do not participate actively, or do not complete assigned work. Your final grade for this course will consist of the following:\\nIssue Proposal 15%\\nAnnotated Bibliography 10%\\nMapping the Issue 25%\\nResearched Position Paper\\t30%\\nResponses/Quizzes 10%\\nClass Participation 10% Final grades will be calculated as follows: A=90-100%, B=80-89%, C=70-79%, F=69%-and below; Z=see the Z grade policy above. All major essay projects must be completed to pass the course. If you fail to complete an essay project, you will fail the course, regardless of your average. Keep all papers until you receive your final grade from the university. You cannot challenge a grade without evidence. Students are expected to keep track of their performance throughout the semester (you can do this by referring to your grades in Blackboard and/or discussing your grades with me) and seek guidance from available sources (including the instructor) if their performance drops below satisfactory levels. I grade on a point system, so you should be able to keep close track of your grades. That means that, instead of averaging your grades, you can simply add up the points for the assignments that youve already received (for instance, the In-Class Essay Exam is 15% or 150 points) to get an idea of where your grade stands. To understand what you need to get the grade you desire, just determine how many more points you need to get that grade. Expectations for Out-of-Class Study: Beyond the time required to attend each class meeting, students enrolled in this course should expect to spend at least an additional 9 hours per week of their own time in course-related activities, including reading required materials, completing assignments, preparing for exams, etc. Grade Grievances: Any appeal of a grade in this course must follow the procedures and deadlines for grade-related grievances as published in the current undergraduate catalog. For undergraduate courses, see http://wweb.uta.edu/catalog/content/general/academic_regulations.aspx#10 Late Assignments. Papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date specified. Reading responses and quizzes will not be accepted late. Assignments turned in after the class has begun will receive a ten-percent deduction unless the instructor has agreed to late submission in advance of the due date. For each calendar day following, the work will receive an additional ten percent deduction. Work is not accepted after three late days. If you must be absent, your work is still due on the assigned date. Revision policy. Revision is an important means for improving both the writing process and the final product. Students have the option of revising ONE of the major essayseither the Issue Proposal or the Mapping the Issue Essayafter it has been graded. The original grade and revision grade will be averaged to arrive at the students final grade for the essay. The last major paper, after it has been submitted for grading, cannot be revised for a higher grade. Attendance Policy. Improvement in writing is a complex process that requires a great deal of practice and feedback from readers. Regular attendance is thus necessary for success in ENGL 1302. Students are expected to attend class regularly and to arrive on time. Excused absences include official university activities, military service, and/or religious holidays. Students must inform the instructor in writing at least one week in advance of an excused absence. After accruing four unexcused absences in a T/Th class or six unexcused absences in an M/W/F class, students will be penalized 5% off their final grade for each additional absence. I will not supply what you miss by email or phone. Please make an appointment to see me in person to discuss absenteeism and tardiness. Please be in class on time, ready to begin the day\\'s activities. Habitual tardiness is one indication of poor time management and life preparation. Classroom behavior. Class sessions are short and require your full attention. All cell phones, pagers, iPods, MP3 players, laptops, and other electronic devices should be turned off and put away when entering the classroom; all earpieces should be removed. Store newspapers, crosswords, magazines, bulky bags, and other distractions so that you can concentrate on the readings and discussions each day. Bring book(s) and e-reserve readings (heavily annotated and carefully read) to every class. Students are expected to participate respectfully in class, to listen to other class members, and to comment appropriately. I also expect consideration and courtesy from students. Professors are to be addressed appropriately and communicated with professionally. According to Student Conduct and Discipline, \"students are prohibited from engaging in or attempting to engage in conduct, either alone or in concert with others, that is intended to obstruct, disrupt, or interfere with, or that in fact obstructs, disrupts, or interferes with any instructional, educational, research, administrative, or public performance or other activity authorized to be conducted in or on a University facility. Obstruction or disruption includes, but is not limited to, any act that interrupts, modifies, or damages utility service or equipment, communication service or equipment, or computer equipment, software, or networks (UTA Handbook or Operating Procedures, Ch. 2, Sec. 2-202). Students who do not respect the guidelines listed above or who disrupt other students learning may be asked to leave class and/or referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Academic Integrity. All students enrolled in this course are expected to adhere to the UT Arlington Honor Code:\\nI pledge, on my honor, to uphold UT Arlingtons tradition of academic integrity, a tradition that values hard work and honest effort in the pursuit of academic excellence. I promise that I will submit only work that I personally create or contribute to group collaborations, and I will appropriately reference any work from other sources. I will follow the highest standards of integrity and uphold the spirit of the Honor Code. Instructors may employ the Honor Code as they see fit in their courses, including (but not limited to) having students acknowledge the honor code as part of an examination or requiring students to incorporate the honor code into any work submitted. Per UT System Regents Rule 50101, 2.2, suspected violations of universitys standards for academic integrity (including the Honor Code) will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Violators will be disciplined in accordance with University policy, which may result in the students suspension or expulsion from the University. It is the philosophy of The University of Texas at Arlington that academic dishonesty is a completely unacceptable mode of conduct and will not be tolerated in any form. All persons involved in academic dishonesty will be disciplined in accordance with University regulations and procedures. Discipline may include suspension or expulsion from the University. \"Scholastic dishonesty includes but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion, the submission for credit of any work or materials that are attributable in whole or in part to another person, taking an examination for another person, any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts\" (Regents Rules and Regulations, Series 50101, Section 2.2) You can get in trouble for plagiarism by failing to correctly indicate places where you are making use of the work of another. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the conventions of citation by which you indicate which ideas are not your own and how your reader can find those sources. Read your textbook and/or handbook for more information on quoting and citing properly to avoid plagiarism. If you still do not understand, ask your instructor. All students caught plagiarizing or cheating will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. Americans with Disabilities Act. The University of Texas at Arlington is on record as being committed to both the spirit and letter of all federal equal opportunity legislation, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). All instructors at UT Arlington are required by law to provide \"reasonable accommodations\" to students with disabilities, so as not to discriminate on the basis of that disability. Any student requiring an accommodation for this course must provide the instructor with official documentation in the form of a letter certified by the staff in the Office for Students with Disabilities, University Hall 102. Only those students who have officially documented a need for an accommodation will have their request honored. Information regarding diagnostic criteria and policies for obtaining disability-based academic accommodations can be found at www.uta.edu/disability or by calling the Office for Students with Disabilities at (817) 272-3364. Drop Policy. Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of the registration period through the late registration period. After the late registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way through the term or session. It is the student\\'s responsibility to officially withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. Students will not be automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of financial aid administered through the University may be required as the result of dropping classes or withdrawing. Contact the Financial Aid Office for more information. Writing Center. The Writing Center, Room 411 in the Central Library, offers tutoring for any writing you are assigned while a student at UT-Arlington. During Fall 2012, Writing Center hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Thursday; 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Friday; and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. You may register and schedule appointments online at uta.mywconline.com or by visiting the Writing Center. If you need assistance with registration, please call 817-272-2601. If you come to the Writing Center without an appointment, you will be helped on a first-come, first-served basis as consultants become available. Writing Center consultants are carefully chosen and trained, and they can assist you with any aspect of your writing, from understanding an assignment to revising an early draft to polishing a final draft. However, the Writing Center is not an editing service; consultants will not correct your grammar or rewrite your assignment for you, but they will help you become a better editor of your own writing. I encourage each of you to use the Writing Center. In addition to one-on-one consultations, the Writing Center will offer FYC and grammar workshops periodically throughout the semester. For more information on these, please visit us at http://www.uta.edu/owl. Library Research Help for Students in the First-Year English Program. UT Arlington Library offers many ways for students to receive help with writing assignments:\\nResearch Librarians: Second floor of Central Library Course-Specific Guides. All First-Year English courses have access to research guides that assist students with required research. To access the guides go to http://libguides.uta.edu. Search for the course number in the search box located at the top of the page. The research guides direct students to useful databases, as well as provide information about citation, developing a topic/thesis, and receiving help. Student Support Services: UT Arlington provides a variety of resources and programs designed to help students develop academic skills, deal with personal situations, and better understand concepts and information related to their courses. Resources include tutoring, major-based learning centers, developmental education, advising and mentoring, personal counseling, and federally funded programs. For individualized referrals, students may visit the reception desk at University College (Ransom Hall), call the Maverick Resource Hotline at 817-272-6107, send a message to resources@uta.edu, or view the information at www.uta.edu/resources. Student Feedback Survey: At the end of each term, students enrolled in classes categorized as lecture, seminar, or laboratory shall be directed to complete a Student Feedback Survey (SFS). Instructions on how to access the SFS for this course will be sent directly to each student through MavMail approximately 10 days before the end of the term. Each students feedback enters the SFS database anonymously and is aggregated with that of other students enrolled in the course. UT Arlingtons effort to solicit, gather, tabulate, and publish student feedback is required by state law; students are strongly urged to participate. For more information, visit http://www.uta.edu/sfs. Electronic Communication Policy. All students must have access to a computer with internet capabilities. Students should check email daily for course information and updates. I will send group emails through MyMav. I am happy to communicate with students through email. However, I ask that you be wise in your use of this tool. Make sure you have consulted the syllabus for answers before you send me an email. Remember, I do not monitor my email 24 hours a day. I check it periodically during the school week and occasionally on the weekend. The University of Texas at Arlington has adopted the University MavMail address as the sole official means of communication with students. MavMail is used to remind students of important deadlines, advertise events and activities, and permit the University to conduct official transactions exclusively by electronic means. For example, important information concerning registration, financial aid, payment of bills, and graduation are now sent to students through the MavMail system. All students are assigned a MavMail account. Students are responsible for checking their MavMail regularly. Information about activating and using MavMail is available at http://www.uta.edu/oit/email/. There is no additional charge to students for using this account, and it remains active even after they graduate from UT Arlington. Conferences and Questions: I have three regularly scheduled office hours each week. These times are reserved for students to drop by or to make an appointment to discuss course assignments, grades, or other class-related concerns. I will be happy to make other appointment times for you if your class schedule conflicts with regular conference times or if I am not available on certain days. If you receive a grade on an assignment or quiz about which you have questions, please wait twenty-four hours before discussing it with me. This gives you time to process the assignment comments and to think about how your course work meets the requirements set forth for each assignment. I do not discuss individual student issues in the classroom before, during or after class. Syllabus and Schedule Changes. Instructors try to make their syllabuses as complete as possible; however, during the course of the semester they may be required to alter, add, or abandon certain policies/assignments. Instructors reserve the right to make such changes as they become necessary. Students will be informed of any changes in writing. Course Schedule. Assignments are due on the day they are listed.

He conducted a survey, as reported in New Scientist Magazine, and it seems Americans are at the bottom of the I believe in evolution totem pole. A survey of 32 European countries, the US and Japan shows that only Turkey is less willing than the US to accept evolution as fact. The percentage of people in the country who accept the idea of evolution has declined from 45 in 1985 to 40 in 2005. This has totally frustrated and confused evolutionists. Some of the insulting and arrogant sentiments expressed by Miller and his colleagues: Religious fundamentalism, bitter partisan politics and poor science education have all contributed to this denial of evolution in the US. \"The US is the only country in which [the teaching of evolution] has been politicized,\" he says. \" Republicans have clearly adopted this as one of their wedge issues. In most of the world, this is a non-issue.\" Miller\\'s report makes for grim reading for adherents of evolutionary theory. Even though the average American has more years of education than when Miller began his surveys 20 years ago, the percentage of people in the country who accept the idea of evolution has declined from 45 in 1985 to 40 in 2005 (Science, vol 313, p 765). That\\'s despite a series of widely publicised advances in genetics, including genetic sequencing, which shows strong overlap of the human genome with those of chimpanzees and mice. \"We don\\'t seem to be going in the right direction,\" Miller says. There is some cause for hope. Team member Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, California, finds solace in the finding that the percentage of adults overtly rejecting evolution has dropped from 48 to 39 in the same time. Meanwhile the fraction of Americans unsure about evolution has soared, from 7 per cent in 1985 to 21 per cent last year. \"That is a group of people that can be reached,\" says Scott. Miller thinks more genetics should be on the syllabus to reinforce the idea of evolution. American adults may be harder to reach: nearly two-thirds don\\'t agree that more than half of human genes are common to chimpanzees. How would these people respond when told that humans and chimps share 99 per cent of their genes? Actually, its closer to 95%, but whose counting. Human DNA is also similar to that of the worms, mosquitoes, and chickens. There is a 75% similarity between the DNA of nematode worms and man. The genes of fruit flies belonging to the Drosophila genus and human genes yielded a similarity of 60%. How should people respond to that, Mr. Miller? Common design is not common ancestry.Republicans politicize poor science education. Meanwhile, evolutionists hope to evangelize the unsure Americans. Who says evolution isnt part of the religion of liberalism as Ann Coulter claims? In her book GODLESS; the Church of Liberalism says, Coulter says, If people are born gay, why hasnt Darwinism weeded out people who dont reproduce? (for that we need a theory of survival of the most fabulous). Perhaps Americans arent buying evolution because we know better. To blindly accept what a mostly atheistic scientific communitycan only call a scientific theory that starts with the end result and attempts to reconstruct the math backwards to make it work is clearly problematic, as evidenced by the numerous revisions science has had to make over the past decades. America has been around longer than Darwinism. America has seen the success of her Judeo-Christian beliefs and the utter failure of cultures that embrace evolution. Heroes of Fascism, Marxism and Communism have all worshipped at the altar of evolution with tragic human results. America has witnessed the decline of Europe and its journey down the drain morally, culturally and economically in its rejection of religion and adherence to Darwinism.Maybe in the end it\\'s because America is largely a religious country that understands faith in a Creator God is morefoolproof than faithin a Father Ape. Maybe Americans have seen \"science\" give proof only to take it back time and time again as the evidence changes, whereas the steadfastness of Creation remains logical and infallible.Maybe because it takesfaith to believe thataNeandertal Man living 350,000 years agofirst discovered in the mid 1800\\'swith only 300 remains found worldwide is sufficient explanation for our evolutionary ancestry is why Americans aren\\'t buying evoluntion,especially since we all personally know 300 people who look like the Neandertal man today!In any case, the day scientists stop condescending to those of us who are \"unsure\" of scientific theory in favor of common sense is the day creationists might say, \"Well, I\\'ll bea monkey\\'s uncle.\" RELATED POSTS:Liberal Infallibility-The Gospel According to Coulter Worm Turds Prove Evolution \\'It\\'s the Demography, Stupid\\' The Eugenics of Communism Jesus on Trial Moral Darwinism in the Anti-War Movement Trackback URL: http://amyproctor.squarespace.com/blog/trackback/653862 Update on Tuesday, August 29, 2006 at 09:49AM by Amy Proctor Pope Prepares to Embrace Theory of Intelligent Design(Hat Tip: Johnny Proctor)John Hooper in RomeMonday August 28, 2006The Guardian Philosophers, scientists and other intellectuals close to Pope Benedict will gather at his summer palace outside Rome this week for intensive discussions that could herald a fundamental shift in the Vatican\\'s view of evolution. There have been growing signs the Pope is considering aligning his church more closely with the theory of \"intelligent design\" taught in some US states. Advocates of the theory argue that some features of the universe and nature are so complex that they must have been designed by a higher intelligence. Critics say it is a disguise for creationism.A prominent anti-evolutionist and Roman Catholic scientist, Dominique Tassot, told the US National Catholic Reporter that this week\\'s meeting was \"to give a broader extension to the debate. Even if [the Pope] knows where he wants to go, and I believe he does, it will take time. Most Catholic intellectuals today are convinced that evolution is obviously true because most scientists say so.\" In 1996, in what was seen as a capitulation to scientific orthodoxy, John Paul II said Darwin\\'s theories were \"more than a hypothesis\". Last week, at a conference in Rimini, Cardinal Christoph Schnborn of Austria revealed that evolution and creation had been chosen as the subjects for this year\\'s meeting of the Pope\\'s Schlerkreis - a group consisting mainly of his former doctoral students that has been gathering annually since the late 1970s. Apart from Cardinal Schnborn, participants at the closed-door meeting will include the president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Peter Schuster; the conservative ethical philosopher Robert Spaemann; and Paul Elbrich, professor of philosophy at Munich University. Last December, a US court sparked controversy when it ruled that intelligent design should not be taught alongside evolution theory. Cardinal Schnborn said: \"The debate of recent months has undoubtedly motivated the Holy Father\\'s choice.\" But he added that in the 1960s the then Joseph Ratzinger had \"underlined emphatically the need to return to the topic of creation\". The Pope also raised the issue in the inaugural sermon of his pontificate, saying: \"We are not the accidental product, without meaning, of evolution.\" A few months later, Cardinal Schnborn, who is regarded as being close to Benedict, wrote an article for the New York Times backing moves to teach ID. He was attacked by Father George Coyne, director of the Vatican Observatory. On August 19, Fr Coyne was replaced without explanation. Vatican sources said the Pope\\'s former astronomer, who has cancer, had asked to be replaced.

Meanwhile, evolutionists hope to evangelize the unsure Americans. Who says evolution isnt part of the religion of liberalism as Ann Coulter claims? In her book GODLESS; the Church of Liberalism says, Coulter says, If people are born gay, why hasnt Darwinism weeded out people who dont reproduce? (for that we need a theory of survival of the most fabulous). August 24, 2006 | Phil Ann Coulter has a great chapter on evolution in \"Godless.\"It drives me nuts the way the Discovery Channel and BBC programming treat darwinian evolution like it\\'s scientific fact, when it\\'s nothing more than a completely unsubstantiated Victorian-age theory.I think the reason secularists/atheists are such big believers in evoution is because they NEED it to be true... otherwise, they\\'d have to believe in God. Theists don\\'t need to believe that evolution is false-- one can believe in God and still believe in evolution-- but atheists need to believe evolution is true. But how about this: even if darwinian evolution were discovered to be scientific fact, we\\'re still left with the question of who or what started the process... August 24, 2006 | Karen I think it\\'s funny how Miller feels so threatened that the number of people who buy evolution have dropped so severely. His solution? Indoctrinate the kids!That doesn\\'t seem to be working either, if certain jr high and high school students in California are anything to judge by.On a different note, it\\'s funny how people say \"religion has caused more wars than blahblahblah\". Really, it makes me wonder how I could\\'ve missed the religious element in both World Wars. The Darwinistic influence is obvious enough though. August 24, 2006 | Trent Great thread, Amy. Powerful, poignant and riveting to read. I laughed my head off when I read this: \"...especially since we all personally know 300 people who look like the Neandertal man today!\"Its true! August 24, 2006 | Johnny \"On a different note, it\\'s funny how people say \"religion has caused more wars than blahblahblah\". Really, it makes me wonder how I could\\'ve missed the religious element in both World Wars. The Darwinistic influence is obvious enough though.\"EXCELLENT POINT! August 24, 2006 | Johnny As mentioned above it is only a \"Theory\" not a proven fact as we all know. They may be scratching their heads in trying to make head or tails on this matter.There is only one irrifutable fact proven time and time again. God the Father is our creator!They need all the luck in trying to dispute that fact.Great post Amy, as always! August 24, 2006 | Leticia I have to be very honest here, Karen is a very intelligent person one of whom I have come to respect.Karen, made several good points here to, she used to have a article on her blog that said if the evolutionists beleive that we came from fish, then why are there still fish.Karen Writes: \"It drives me nuts the way the Discovery Channel and BBC programming treat darwinian evolution like it\\'s scientific fact, when it\\'s nothing more than a completely unsubstantiated Victorian-age theory.\"The reason for that Karen is that the Left do not beleive in GOD and they have to beleive in something so they preferr to beleive in something that is so obtuse that no one else could believe in no matter how many of the Leftist started nagging on that.Another excellant point that Karen made here is: I think the reason secularists/atheists are such big believers in evoution is because they NEED it to be true... otherwise, they\\'d have to believe in God. That is so very True Karen. Also You went on and stated: Theists don\\'t need to believe that evolution is false--one can believe in God and still believe in evolution-- but atheists need to believe evolution is true. Why is that It is because they need to beleive in something because to have nothing to beleive in is a very empty feeling.This point here that Karen made hits the nail right on the head and it still baffles the Evolutionist today.But how about this: even if darwinian evolution were discovered to be scientific fact, we\\'re still left with the question of who or what started the process...Johnny Writes: \"...especially since we all personally know 300 people who look like the Neandertal man today!\"Johnny, Those that look like the Neandertal man of today are all Liberals. LOL August 24, 2006 | Phil There is, in case anyone is interested, an informative and funny audio lecture on the problems of evolution here: http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/searchprog.asp. The talk is about an hour long but worth it. You\\'ll need Real Player to listen to it but if you don\\'t have it click the \"return to searh page\" on the site and download it. It\\'s completely free.A whole series of mostly short essays can be found here: http://www.catholiceducation.org/links/search.cgi?query=darwin&submit.x=21&submit.y=13I just finished reading ARCHITECTS OF THE CULTURE OF DEATH by Donald De Marco and Benjamin Wiker. It\\'s excellent, and even I understood most of it. They have an essay on Darwin. They don\\'t focus much on his theory in THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES but on the racist theories he drew up on its basis. This he did in a book called THE DESCENT OF MAN. By the way, the full title of the Origin of Species is this: THE ORIGIN OF SPEICIES BY MEANS OF NATURAL SELECTION OR THE PRESERVATION OF FAVORED RACES IN THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE. Scratch an evolutionist and you\\'ll find a eugenicist. August 24, 2006 | Dim Bulb, freak show, sick puppy Johnny (or should I call you Mr. Proctor?),\"Blah, blah, blah,\" is right. By all accounts America is a faith nation, but how many of its wars have been motivated by religion? If any nations wars should have been motivated by religion (assuming that religion leads necessarily to wars) it is this one. Most of our wars were in fact motivated by greed of some kind, such as land or natural resources. That holds true for most other wars. Also, political ideaologies are a major factor.\"War is hell, and you can;t refine it.\" (General William T. Sherman). Because war is so nasty and frightening people \"get religion.\" There are few atheists or liberals in fox holes. My dad has many audio tapes of talks given by Archbishop Fulton Sheen. I recall him once talking about how during WW II the atheist communists in Russia began talking about \"Holy Mother Russia\" and began encouraging people to attend church. Even the un-devote will turn to their god or gods in a war. When people claim that religion has started more wars than anthing else they\\'re looking at the facade rather than the facts. August 24, 2006 | Dim Bulb, freak show, sick puppy Amy,In your article, you used the phrase \"worshipped at the altar of evolution\"... Now that\\'s a bit scary, since I used almost that exact same phrase in the manuscript of my book (never published) back in 1982, and concerning the exact same subject! (Goose bumps now going up and down body!)Perhaps we can attribute this \"coincidence\" to the Holy Spirit who may enjoy using this particular phrase??God Bless... August 24, 2006 | Hawkeye P.S.-- BTW, have you had a chance to check out my newest website... \"Victory Against Terror\"?http://victory.envy.nu/index.htmI would appreciate any comments you might have for how to improve the site, etc.Best regards to you and Johnny... August 24, 2006 | Hawkeye DimBulb, et al:I was quoting Trent above in the \\'war...\\' remarks, so your very astute remarks belong to Trent, not me. you can call me Johnny, that\\'s fine.Your Dad is a Catholic theologian, or just a Bishop Sheen fan? August 24, 2006 | Johnny Hawkeye, your VAT website is terrific. The Battalion Commander\\'s letter is priceless and every word is true. Thanks for posting that! August 24, 2006 | Johnny ']\n",

This course looks at how, by \"enchaining\" the peoples and cultures of nations once under its rule and \"enchaining\" itself to these nations in a common history of Empire, England and its literature both shaped and were shaped by these relations. We will begin with late Victorian examples of literature explicitly or implicitly involving British colonial relationships, written from a British point of view, then focus on contemporary fiction written in English from areas once but no longer under British colonial rule: The Indian Subcontinent, Nigeria and South Africa, the Carribean, and the U.K. itself. We will examine how colonial literature imagines the \"other\" and how those representations relate to material realities, as well as how the \"postcolonial\" literature by writers from the once-colonized nations resist and re-imagine their identities and their relationships to colonial history. This literature is historically, politically, and culturally engaged, as well as culturally, thematically and stylistically diverse varyingly marked by adventure, romance, tragedy, humor, social realism, and experimental narrative forms. A number of the novels on this syllabus have won or were short-listed for the prestigious Booker Prize.

Ralph Waldo Emerson Divinity School Address, 1838 Not even one generation passed before the young movement of Unitarians experienced a rebellion from within their own ranks. Inspired by the thought of German Idealism (Kant, Hegel) and British Transcendentalism (Coleridge, Carlyle), a group of young Unitarian men and women began to preach a new religion of intuition and personal experience. They called themselves the Transcendentalists.\\nDaniel Walker Howes article will provide an overview of the period we are covering in this unit, 18351865.

What is persistent, he argues, from Edwards to Emerson is the Puritans effort to confront, face to face, the image of a blinding divinity in the physical universe, and to look upon that universe without the intermediacy of ritual, of the Mass and the confessional.

ASU e-mail address. You are responsible for checking your ASU e-mail address on a daily basis. Notifications about the course will be sent via blackboard to your ASU e-mail address. No other e-mail address is acceptable for use in this course. 2. Blackboard Course Management System (http://blackboard.angelo.edu). Blackboard (Bb) is a course management system that enables you to practice your critical thinking skills in regard to your coursework. Bb course content is arranged in modules. Each module contains relevant course documents as well as related media such as online learning modules, offering you a platform for study outside of class. Through Bb you can check your grades, communicate with your instructor, catch up on recent classroom announcements, and access the syllabus and other course documents/handouts. Course Description: This course is designed to encourage and teach you how to take better care of yourself and your brainthat personal, three pound computer of yours that looks like a turkey meatloaf and is made up of a hundred billion neurons. Your brain is not a fixed, mechanical device. Its better. Given the right information, you can nurture it, alter its structure, rewire it, increase its levels of oxygen and nutrition and enlarge its mass. Over the many years, the size of the human brain has tripled. The latest and most improved addition to your brain is its front porch, AKA, the prefrontal cortex. This bit of cranial real estate is the most turbo-powered, executive suite of them all. Remember grandmas lamenting about some kids (but not you, of course) having to learn everything the hard way. Well the most advantageous aspect of your being a proud owner of a prefrontal cortex is its ability to serve as a handy dandy experience simulator. This is an incredible anatomical advancement. It is why youre not likely to be ordering anchovy and liver yogurt at Baskin Robbins any time soon. **Syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructors** Hanby & Kulig Freshman Seminar: Train Your Brain 2 Consider flight simulators. Wet behind the ears pilots practice in flight simulators to avoid crashing and burning right off the bat in their cockpits or box offices on account of their inexperience. Similarly, you, thanks to your prefrontal cortex flight simulator, can experience things in advance in your head without having to live them out catastrophically by making rookie mistakes. College freshmen smack up against formidable contenders: on average 1,125,000 students dropout; the average college student debt after college is $23,700; the number of college students arrested at spring break is 88,750; and on average 62 parties are attended by college students in a 52 week year. Not to mention binge drinking, date rape, hooking up/breaking up, long distance relationships, cheating in all its nefarious forms, cliques (are there more or less at college than there were in high school), roommate dramarama, attractiveness issues (even the number one entertainer in the world overcorrected on that one), time mismanagement/crushing fatigue, and the fact that it still only takes three seconds to cross a median strip at sixty miles an hour. Students electing to take this course will punch each other awake. Youll serve as one anothers mirrors as you shake things up by considering obstacles that could do you in during your freshman year at college in the same way that an iceberg did in the Titanic. Course Objectives: The brain responds to intellectual stimulation, exercise, and socialization opportunities. It can be gnawed by stress; and conserved through stress management. It is affected by rest, the practice of faith, and fun. (Tickle it over here and it laughs over there.) Within 15 minutes of any meal, snack, or drink, whats been ingested is impacting the brain. Eating healthfully what the brain most wants for breakfast, lunch and dinner augments it. Your heart will be similarly impacted; for you have a pump. You are, however, your brain. Were going to break open some infamous animal house antics in order to let in a little light. And were going to challenge you to share what you discover. As you meet cognitive challenges, levels of chemicals essential to learning increase in your brain. And when you are learning, you are going to be upgrading your brains circuitry, changing and improving the level at which it performs. The brain loves novelty and in this course, we introduce students to whats new in the way of taking better care of ones brain. Our aim is to equip freshmen to live a more brain facilitative lifestyle --within the enriched but legendarily challenging environment of a first semester at college. The sooner students open themselves to brain facilitative lifestyle interventions, the sooner they will begin to hardwire into their still very malleable minds the idea that they do not have to learn the hard way. Were going to re-tool your thinking as together we break open some of the more common poor choices made by young adults. 1. Learn to apply course material (e.g., goal setting, organizational skills, stress management, brain facilitative skills) to improve thinking, problem solving, and decisions. 2. Learn to find and use resources for answering questions or solving problems 3. Learn to analyze and critically evaluate ideas, arguments, and points of view Student Learning Outcomes: **Syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructors** Hanby & Kulig Freshman Seminar: Train Your Brain 3 We will learn about and discuss a variety of strategies designed to help you transition into college and help you succeed in your college career and beyond. At the completion of this course, you will demonstrate higher-level critical thinking and core study skills strategies. By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following: Apply time management skills and set goals Access and use campus resources effectively Demonstrate critical thinking and problem-solving skills Student Learning Assessment: Student learning outcomes are measured by direct and indirect class participation, classroom exercises and activities, weekly activities, presentations, and your final project all of which are directly related to the course objectives. Class Requirements: Attendance and Participation: Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all class meetings and mentor sessions. Occasionally, there will be out of class assignments meant to prepare you for class participation. These assignments are required and will factor into your attendance and participation grade. (5%) Journal Assignments: You will complete weekly assignments in your Journal and Appointment Book for Avoiding First Semester Rookie Mistakes. These assignments will due on Tuesday and Thursday and will be graded pass or fail based on completeness. (20%) Presentation: You will develop a brief (approximately 15 minute) course lecture on a specified topic. This will account for 25% of your final grade for the course. Grades will be based upon: 1. Creativity (3 points) 2. Exposition (graphs and charts, organization of display, workmanship, creativity, abstract and bibliography documenting information presented) (4 points) 3. Thoroughness (coverage of topic; completion; comprehension of topic) (4 points) 4. Presentation (Knowledge of topic, interest in topic, oral presentation, appearance) (4 points) 5. Scientific thought (organization; accuracy of observations, scientific methodology, interpretation of data) (5 points) Flight Plan: Based on your presentation and the follow-up discussion with your peer mentor and classmates, you will develop a flight plan for avoiding common mistakes common to your topic area. You will post a draft of your flight plan in Blackboard as a blog. This will give your fellow classmates further opportunity to comment and help you in constructing your flight plan. After receiving feedback, you will submit your finalized flight plan. The finalized flight plan is worth 10% of your final grade. Your feedback to your fellow classmates is worth 5% of your final grade. **Syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructors** Hanby & Kulig Freshman Seminar: Train Your Brain 4 Semester Project (35% of grade): You will demonstrate your learning by choosing to undertake one of the following: A. Write, produce and star in a peer instructive video vignettes relating to living a more brain facilitative lifestyle while at college B. Draft an article for potential publication ASUs Rampage relating to living a more brain facilitative lifestyle C. Develop an hour long television program centering on avoiding rookie mistakes ones freshman year for ASUs Ram TV: Channel Six. Describe four differing viewpoints for the panelists.

As an ASU student, you are responsible for understanding and adhering to this code. Likewise, ASU faculty should strive to create an environment in which academic honesty and personal ethics are held in the highest regard. Talk to me, your instructor, if you have a question concerning academic integrity. ASU Student Handbook: http://www.angelo.edu/cstudent/documents/pdf/Student_Handbook.pdf The ASU Student Handbook contains our Student Academic Honor Code Statement: Angelo State University expects its students to maintain complete honesty and integrity in their academic pursuits. Additionally, ASU expects all students to engage in all academic pursuits in a manner that is above reproach and to maintain complete honesty and integrity in the academic experiences both in and out of the classroom. Academic integrity means the student does his or her own academic work, unless the instructor explicitly permits collaboration. Cheating will not be tolerated and will result in a failing grade in the course.

The Gazette will be profiling the student award winners this week. The John C. and Louise P. Wood Undergraduate Scholarship By Colleen Kearney Rich Victor MendezVictor M. Mendez is feeling the pressure not just the pressure that comes with being an electrical engineering major maintaining a 3.79 GPA, but the responsibility of being an example. Mendez is the first person in his family to seek a college education. I need to set a model for my siblings, he says, that shows that making it to college is not enough, you must strive to be among the best. Mendez is used to facing challenges. When he came to the United States from El Salvador at age 11, he needed to learn English. Since then, he has gone on to assist others with their language acquisition, helping Latino children improve their Spanish reading and writing skills. He also credits his participation in Masons Early Identification Program since the seventh grade for some of his successes thus far. Thanks to EIP, I learned that college was within my grasp. Since being admitted to Mason, he has had the opportunity to give back to the EIP Program, serving as a tutor and mentor for the program in 2005 and 2006. He is also a member of Masons Hispanic Student Association and has held a number of part-time jobs, all while maintaining his place on the Deans List academically. This scholarship will provide some of the financial support Mendez needs to concentrate on his studies. He expects to graduate in May 2009. The John C. and Louise P. Wood Graduate Scholarship By David Driver Nelson FelicianoPhotos by Laura SikesNelson Feliciano lived in a tough neighborhood in Newark, N.J., until the start of third grade, when his family moved to a new, more challenging neighborhood. I hated school. I associated school with harassment and bullying. I spent most of the day watching the clock, says Feliciano. In high school, a counselor told him not to spend a lot of time filling out college applications. Despite this, Feliciano applied to and attended Rutgers University, graduating with a BA in anthropology and English. In 2005, Feliciano enrolled at Mason, and he now plans to graduate in December with an MA in anthropology. One of the many roles Feliciano has taken on at Mason is resident advisor, where he works with students on the Passport Learning Community floor and tutors Chinese students enrolled in the universitys 1-2-1 program. He has also worked as a teaching assistant to anthropology professor Susan Trencher. Last summer, he traveled to Christchurch, New Zealand, to assist in research on the effect of global warming in urban areas. The research helped me better understand how such things as flooding and violent winds are getting worse due to global warming and that the impact it will have on heavily populated areas will be as catastrophic, if not worse, as the tragedies that came to pass during Hurricane Katrina, he says. The Wood scholarship will provide Feliciano the support and time he needs to finish his thesis. If you can prove you have the drive and skills, there are organizations out there to help you, he says. Feliciano hopes to one day teach at the university level.

(2012). Abnormal psychology (12th edition). New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ISBN: 978-1-118-01849-1; BRV ISBN: 978-1-118-12912-8 COURSE PREREQUISITE: Introductory Psychology In this course, you will be given a detailed look at the causes, consequences and possible treatments for abnormal behavior. We will discuss what makes a behavior abnormal as well as what techniques may be used to assess behavior. We will survey mental disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) and those proposed for the next edition. This will include diagnosis, classification, and treatment of various mental and behavioral disorders. As time permits, we will track the development of various treatment techniques and use case examples, films, and demonstrations whenever possible to illustrate key points. Abnormal behavior is a vast and complicated area of psychology and covers everything from depression to hallucinations to phobias. We will attempt to understand these disorders in terms of factors that may have lead to their development and what factors might help us understand, explain, and, eventually, cure and prevent them. STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES & COURSE CONTENT OBJECTIVES: The Department of Psychology has adopted expected student learning outcomes for the undergraduate major, the graduate major, and for PSY 1300, a general education course meeting a requirement for the social and behavioral science component. These expected student learning outcomes are available for your review at the following website: http://www.psych.txstate.edu/assessment/ The following objectives are specific examples of the kinds of questions and concepts you should be prepared to discuss in this course via your course exams and your course papers. Specific exam questions will demand that you be able to provide relevant and accurate responses to these objectives: Psychology 3315 Page 2 of 7 1.) Understands Abnormal Behavior 1.1 defines abnormal 1.2 explains diagnostic criteria in diagnosing abnormal behavior 1.3 understands the basic models used to describe abnormal behavior 1.4 explains how definitions of abnormal have changed throughout history 2.) Understands How Abnormal Behaviors Develop 2.1 explains the Biological model of abnormal behavior 2.2 explains the Psychodynamic model of abnormal behavior 2.3 explains the Behavioral model of abnormal behavior 2.4 explains the Cognitive model of abnormal behavior 2.5 explains the Humanistic and Existential models of behavior 2.6 explains Family, Couples, and Group perspectives of abnormal behavior 3.) Understands Basic Assessment of Abnormal Behavior 3.1 explains the use of observations to assess abnormal behavior 3.2 explains the use of interviews to assess abnormal behavior 3.3 explains the use of psychological tests to assess abnormal behavior 3.4 explains the use of neurological tests to assess abnormal behavior 3.5 understands the ethical concerns involved in assessing abnormal behavior 4.) Understands the Basic Classification Methods in Abnormal Behavior 4.1 explains the diagnostic categories used in the DSM-IV-TR or proposed revision 4.2 understands the advantages and disadvantages of using manuals like the DSM-IV-TR 4.3 describes alternative methods for classifying abnormal behavior patterns 5.) Understands the basic disorders and can distinguish between them 5.1 explains anxiety disorders 5.2 understands the major phobic disorders 5.3 explains stress disorders 5.4 describes dissociative disorders 5.5 explains somatoform disorders 5.6 describes conduct disorders 5.7 explains substance-related disorders 5.8 understands disorders of mood and thought 5.9 explains psychotic disorders 5.10 understands cognitive and developmental disorders 6.) Understands Treatments Used for Each Major Disorder Discussed 6.1 describes the relative advantages and disadvantages of various treatment strategies 6.2 explains individual approaches to treatment 6.3 understands the group approaches to treatment Psychology 3315 Page 3 of 7 6.4 explains the psychodynamic approach to treatment 6.5 understands eclectic approaches to treatment The short list above is a good sampling of the concepts you will learn in this course. To keep track of your understanding of such issues, we will have 2 1-hour exams, case-study assignments, a comprehensive final exam and exit reaction cards. COURSE THEMES: Besides specific learning objectives listed above, there are themes that will weave throughout this course and our discussions. Your understanding of the learning objectives will be tested with exams. Your understanding of the course themes will be measured by your in-class discussion, exit reaction cards and Case Study Assignments. Before describing grades for the course and specific information about papers and assignments, I will describe these course themes. 1.) Abnormal is culturally and historically determined. * what we perceive as abnormal varies by culture * what we view as abnormal or normal changes across time 2.) Abnormal behaviors are symptoms of an underlying problem, not the problem itself * we cannot treat a disorder by simply treating the symptoms * we must dig down & uncover the problem(s) actually causing the symptoms 3.) Abnormal behaviors are signals of a persons attempt to communicate, compensate for and/or deal with underlying problems * a person suffering from Schizophrenia, for example, may hear voices telling him to do bad things. As a result, he may flap his hands constantly by his ears to shoo the voices away. * to us, this behavior is odd. To him, however, is may be an attempt to deal with what is otherwise impossible to understand and cope with. Our ability to successfully treat a disorder requires that we look beyond the symptoms and ask what is causing the symptoms that we see. 4.) Most serious disorders have underlying biological causes * although we do not always know the cause, we will eventually uncover it * this also explains why medications can be so effective as forms of treatment 5.) Most disorders can be effectively treated with proper diagnosis and care. Few of the most serious disorders, however, can be completely cured. 6.) People have disorders and are affected by them. They are NOT the disorder. People First language is expected in all written assignments and discussions. Examples: A person is NOT a schizophrenic, but a person with schizophrenia. A person is NOT a Borderline, but a person with Borderline Personality Disorder. Psychology 3315 Page 4 of 7 GRADES FOR THE COURSE: 2 In-Class Exams 40% (40 Qs/200 pts. each exam) = 400 points Participation/Attendance 10% (10 pts. per class) = 100 points 5 Exit/Reaction Cards 5% (10 pts. ea.) = 50 points 2 Case Study Assignments 20% (10% ea.) = 200 points Comprehensive Final Exam 25% (50 Qs) = 250 points Total = 1000 points EXAMS There will be 2 In-Class exams consisting of 40 multiple-choice questions. Each test will be worth 200 points, 5 points per question. The Final Exam will consist of 50 multiple-choice questions, worth 5 points each, for a total of 250 points. Taking the Chapter Exams on the Wiley website can definitely help with learning the material and taking the tests. The exams can be accessed by going to http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002001.html then clicking on Student Companion Site under Student Resources on the right side of the page. EXIT CARDS: Students will need to purchase a packet of note cards for this course. At least five times during the summer session, at the end of the class period, I want you to turn in one of these cards. On the card, you are to respond to the days discussion, ask questions, reflect on the material, discuss issues you want to address but did not want to discuss during class time, let me know how you think the course is going, give me suggestions for the course, etc. Lets have a discussion. It is NOT sufficient to simply turn in a card with your name on it or to say no comments or questions. If you turn a card in with only your name or a non-substantive comment, I will NOT give you the points for that day. At the very least, reflect on the material and make some comment about what you learned, what confuses you, what you would like to learn more about, etc. These will be useful for me in monitoring student understanding, and I will respond personally to ALL cards turned in and return them to you the next class period. You will earn a possible 5% (50 points) of your course grade if you turn the required minimum number of cards (5). This allows you to miss a few class periods and still be able to earn the maximum number of points for exit cards. You will not get extra points for turning in more than 5 cards. Psychology 3315 Page 5 of 7 PARTICIPATION/ATTENDANCE: I will be taking attendance and giving 10 points per class for participation/attendance. This is a very short time frame in which to learn a great deal of material. I will be sending an attendance sheet around in each class. I will deduct 10 points from your total score for each missed class. CASE STUDY ASSIGNMENTS: There will be 2 case study assignments. These will be posted on TRACS. You are to follow the instructions and turn in a 3 page double-spaced response on the dates listed below. Please provide a list of references used in providing your responses. When you are asked for references, an online Google search is NOT acceptable. All references should some from the Alkek Library where you can search journals and databases. Citations should be in APA style. MAKE-UP POLICY: It is generally NOT my policy to give make-up exams or assignments. I do, however, realize that sometimes circumstances are beyond a students control. In such cases you MUST contact me prior to missing the exam or assignment or as soon after missing it as possible. Except in extreme circumstances, the missed exam or assignment must be made up within one week of the missed date. All make-up exams and assignments will require an excuse with documentation. You will not be allowed to make-up more than one exam or assignment, so please use that missed exam or assignment wisely. All late assignments (including exams after one week and only after being excused with documentation) will be docked 2% for each weekday they are late. The maximum penalty for late work is 20% which is still better than a zero. GRADING PHILOSOPHY: It is my belief that no instructor can effectively communicate 100% of the intended material with perfect accuracy and, as such, final grades should not be based on the assumption that a perfect score is possible. I will use a curve. Rather than using the highest score possible (1000 points) to establish 90, 80, 70, & 60% grade cutoffs, then, I use the highest score actually obtained across the assignments as a 100% score. For example, if you earned 885 points, and I used the traditional method for calculating your grade, I would divide your 885 points by 1000 for an 88% or a B. With my method, however, I use the high score as the divisor. Let us say that the highest score is 975, then I would divide your 885 points by 975 (instead of 1000) for a score of 91%, or an A. As you can see, my method can make a big difference in your GPA giving you a 4.0 instead of a 3.0. Psychology 3315 Page 6 of 7 SPECIAL NEEDS: Any student who believes that he/she has a need for special accommodations should contact the Student Disabilities Office which is located in the Student Center. I will gladly comply with their recommendations regarding special accommodations for any student who may qualify. NOTE TAKING AND RECORDING POLICY: The lectures and course materials I bring to this class belong to me and the sources from which I draw upon to design them. You are authorized to take notes for your own personal use, but you are not authorized to record my lectures or reproduce materials without my written permission. PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT STATEMENT ON ACADEMIC HONESTY: Learning and teaching take place best in an atmosphere of intellectual fair-minded openness. All members of the academic community are responsible for supporting freedom and openness through rigorous personal standards of honesty and fairness. Plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty undermine the very purpose of the university and diminish the value of education. Texas State Policy: Violation of the Honor Code includes but is not limited to, cheating on an examination or other work, plagiarism, collusion and the abuse of resource materials. (UPPS 07.10.01) Psychology Policy: The study of psychology is best done in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Academic dishonesty, in any form, destroys this atmosphere. Academic dishonesty consists of any of a number of things that spoil a good student-teacher relationship. A list of academically dishonest behaviors include: (1) passing off others work as ones own, (2) copying off another person during an examination, (3) signing another persons name on an attendance sheet, (4) in written papers, paraphrasing from an outside source awhile failing to credit the source or copying more than four words in a sequence without quotation marks and appropriate citation. The Psychology Department faculty believe that appropriate penalties for academic dishonesty include an F in the course and/or prosecution through the Student Justice System. During an exam a student may be asked to change seats if I observe any problem. This does not mean that you are being accused of cheating; rather I am trying to prevent a potential problem from occurring.

Roberts University of Redlands 2002 University of Redlands Master of Business Administration School of Business COURSE: BUAD 687, Legal Issues for Business and Management UNITS: 3 CLUSTER: LOCATION/MEETING TIMES: 6:00-10:00 pm, INSTRUCTOR: G. Keith Roberts, J.D., LL.M. OFFICE: 129B, Hornby Hall OFFICE PHONE: 909.748.6350 FAX: 909.335.5125 INSTRUCTOR E-MAIL: keith_roberts@redlands.edu INSTRUCTOR WEB SITE: http://e-redlands.uor.edu/kroberts COURSE DESCRIPTION: BUAD 687 Legal Issues for Business and Management (3). Identification and examination of legal issues that managers confront in the business environment, domestic as well as global. Emphasis on identifying legal issues before they become legal problems. COURSE OVERVIEW: The importance of the legal environment to business and management is more apparent today than ever before. The legal environment is a moving river and changes in laws have a direct as well as indirect impact on the management community. Although the 2 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 basic rules of law remain stable for many years, new issues affecting our professional and personal lives are presented often. Such issues will continue to arise, and probably accelerate in this new century, presenting management with extremely difficult decision problems. Management is constantly facing problems, which might be easily solvable on a bottom line profit basis, but present perplexing problems in terms of their social consequences. The text material here presents information on substantive and procedural law, including questions of ethics, from the perspective of the management community. The course is not meant to replicate subject material as presented to law students in graduate law schools, nor is it designed to make the student an expert in one or more areas of the law. It is, rather, designed to introduce areas of study providing a framework for the analysis of problems confronting management, and alerting them to areas requiring professional counsel. MAJOR TOPICS: Major topics to be covered are: Common Law and Sources of Law Ethics and Social Responsibility Court Systems ADR E-Commerce Disputes Constitutional Regulation Crimes Torts Product Liability Copyrights and Trademarks Cyberlaw Contracts and the U.C.C. Structure of and Fiduciary Responsibilities in Business Organizations Employment Relationships and EEO Consumer Protection Environment Promoting Competition International Transactions 3 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 LEARNING OBJECTIVES: The student will be able to: Critically analyze the impact of law on business management. Recognize a legal problem and evaluate possible solutions by discerning the facts, the legal principles, the result, and the impact on business. Critically analyze judicial decisions. Evaluate the legal, managerial, and ethical ramifications of business problems.

Each student will submit two copies of the paper. One copy will be submitted to the Instructor, and one copy will be submitted to another student for review. Students will give each other written feedback. Students should not worry too much about each others grammar. [If there are a million sentence fragments, the student could say something like I had a hard time understanding what you were trying to say because of all the sentence fragments.] Students will focus on responding to the ideas, developing complexity, and the readers ability to understand what the writer is trying to communicate. A peer review sheet is distributed with specific questions about whether the substantive requirements of the assignment have been met, the documentation is appropriate, accurate, and 7 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 complete, and the grammar and style are satisfactory. Peer response is an exercise in community, not in judging. Each student will receive peer feedback at Workshop 1. The instructors feedback will be received no later than Workshop 2. A revision of the paper is due at Workshop 3. Each student will orally present the paper to the class during one of the remaining Workshops. ONLINE DISCUSSIONS: To encourage student reflection and interaction in this six-week course, students will participate in two online discussions. Topics will be given at the end of specific class periods as well as posted on the course Blackboard site. Student contributions will be assessed based on their ability to address the issues presented and engage fellow students in a thoughtful progression of ideas. Initial contributions to online discussions must be made no later than 24 hours prior to class to allow sufficient time for everyone to respond. QUIZZES/FINAL EXAM: There will be two in-class quizzes (Workshops 2 and 4) comprised of multiple choice and true/false questions based on the prior Workshops material. [Workshop 2 quiz based on Workshop 1 material; Workshop 4 quiz based on Workshops 2 and 3 material.] The final exam will be at Workshop 6. PAPER #1: Prepare a three-page typed (double-spaced) paper that summarizes and discusses the Sources of Ethical Standards discussed in Chapter 2 (1 -2 pages). [Use your own words. For instance, what did Kant contribute?] Then answer one (1) of the Questions and Case Problems at the end of Chapter 2 (1 page). The draft is due at Workshop 3 (10% deduction if not submitted by Workshop 3). Draft (with instructor comments) will be returned at Workshop 4. The final paper is due at Workshop 5. PAPER #2: 8 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 Prepare a four or five-page typed (double-spaced) paper on a legal topic approved by the instructor. You will analyze the legal and/or ethical issue(s). Paper due at Workshop 6. GRADING CRITERIA FOR PAPERS #1 & #2: 1. analysis 2. reference to relevant issues and materials in the literature 3. well-argued case 4. well-presented material 5. appropriate use of English 6. Spelling and grammar are considered important. Grade reduction will be proportionate to the number and severity of errors. 7. Plagiarism and/or copyright infringement will be severely penalized. ACADEMIC HONESTY: Your attention is invited to the University of Redlands policy on Academic Honesty. Both the standards of academic honesty and the procedures for addressing academic dishonesty are outlined in detail in the University of Redlands Catalog. INSTRUCTOR POLICIES: Each 3-unit (Carnegie Unit) graduate course is the equivalent of 135 hours. That is equivalent to 22.5 hours per week for 6 weeks. Since you will spend 4 hours each week in class, it is expected that your homework will be approximately 18 hours per week. Attendance at Workshops is required. A student who is consistently late or misses a substantial portion of the class, must meet with the instructor to discuss extra work. Anyone missing more than two Workshops (or more than 8 hours of Workshop time throughout the course), regardless of the reason, will not be able to earn a passing grade, should withdraw immediately, and make arrangements with his/her academic advisor to take it at another time. An \"incomplete\" is not given for poor or neglected work. A grade of \"incomplete\" is to be granted only for very special 9 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 reasons. The granting of an incomplete grade should occur only after a discussion between faculty and student, initiated by the student. The decision of whether or not to grant an incomplete is dependent on an emergency situation which prevents the student from completing (on time) the work necessary for the course. An incomplete grade will be converted to a permanent grade within eight weeks from the last night of the course. This means that the instructor must turn in the grade to the Registrar no later than the eighth week. Any incomplete work must be submitted to the instructor with enough lead time for the instructor to evaluate the work and issue a grade change. Assignments submitted late will be downgraded 2% per calendar day of delay. The only exception is the 10% deduction specified above in regard to Paper #1. CLASS OPERATIONS: Although law classes are often conducted utilizing lectures primarily, a law class of this nature will benefit all participants most effectively through maximum student participation. HOW TO SURVIVE THIS COURSE: The text discusses broad legal concepts, legal rules, exceptions to rules, and exceptions to the exceptions. It is far more important that the student has a good feel for the broad concepts and important legal rules than he or she retains any amount of detailed information concerning exceptions, etc. The idea is for the student to be able to apply his or her broad knowledge to real-world problems. This is the payoff to this course. It is important that the student thinks about the concepts and their application and let the rest of the class know what he or she is thinking. A portion of the student\\'s grade is dependent upon his or her participation, and the students will to a large extent teach themselves. As you concentrate on your studies, you may want to keep the following in mind: When you have learned a lot, you have earned a bachelors degree. 10 Revised (4/11/02) Master Syllabus-K. Roberts University of Redlands 2002 When you have learned even more, but have discovered you really dont know much at all, you have earned a masters degree. When you have learned even more still, and again come to realize you dont know much at allbut also realize that neither does anyone else, you have earned a doctorate. Help is readily available. If the student should have a question about something he or she has read, a concept, an assignment, whatever...he or she should send an e-mail or call. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANT...there is no law that says this course can\\'t be a lot of fun. So ENJOY! ']\n",

I\\'ve been reading the magazine for a long time, and in my opinion \"Justice Delayed\" is the single best article ever published in the magazine. It should be required reading for everyone in the media world. John L. Kirby Portales, New Mexico As a lawyer who also writes an occasional op-ed column for my local newspaper, I was impressed and gratified by Rachel Smolkin\\'s masterful analysis of the media\\'s many failures in the Duke case. It seemed as if every journalist became a mouthpiece for the prosecution, with particularly egregious examples found in papers that normally trumpet the importance of due process. In fact, the New York Times, among others, seemed to want to give greater constitutional protections to Jose Padilla than to three young lacrosse players. Ultimately, everyone bears responsibility for this grave miscarriage of justice, from Mike Nifong and his prosecutorial juggernaut to a lying accuser to the jaded and opportunistic multicultural mafia on the Duke faculty. But it is the media\\'s dereliction of duty that troubles me most. Prosecutors can be disbarred, perjurers prosecuted and academics fired. But renegade journalists wrap themselves in the First Amendment far too often as an excuse for shoddy performance. And we let them. It would be nice if the same people who crucified the media for giving President Bush a free pass on Iraq would have demanded the same accountability on behalf of three innocent lacrosse players. Christine Flowers Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Rachel Smolkin did an outstanding job analyzing the good, bad and outrageous coverage of the Duke lacrosse fiasco. My cop reporter instincts told me from the start there was much that was fishy about the story. I followed the coverage intently in print and online as the sordid mess unfolded and was astonished at how many putatively objective journalists were so quick to swallow an agenda-driven party line. The episode should be a case study for J-school students, and Smolkin\\'s article should lead the syllabus. Bob Fredericks Local news editor Journal News/LoHud.com White Plains, New York What an excellent, comprehensive review of this sorry tale. Daniel Okrent\\'s comment about the charges fitting into \"preconceived notions of too many in the press\" sums it up. I don\\'t blame you for avoiding the rat\\'s nest of political ideology in your summary, but it is inescapable that the case illustrates the cultural prejudices brought to journalism on race and gender issues by the sorts of folks who seem to predominate in editorial boardrooms. I don\\'t think the ordinary consumers of journalism believed much of mainstream reporting on these issues even before the Duke case; the \"liberal\" stereotypes conflicted too greatly with the reality they experienced daily. People in the profession should stop being in denial about this problem. Mark Richard Columbus, Ohio Many thanks for the fine piece about journalistic missteps in coverage of the Duke \"rape\" case. One of the aspects of the case at which you and others hint but which is never explicitly addressed is that Duke is in the South. And there are those Americans who believe Southerners are almost genetically different stupider, more violent, racist and inbred than citizens of any other quadrant of the country. Amadou Diallo, Rodney King, regional black officials and decades of racial progress notwithstanding, the American South is still considered by too many people (mostly those ignorant of the area) to be the seat of all the most heinous recent racial crimes in the U.S. And certainly the Duke case was initially played as poor black victim vs. elite white Southern university town. Never mind that the three young men (falsely) charged came from other parts of the country. So much of the rest of the country is ignorant of and oblivious to my region, until some satisfying, stereotypical and sometimes ill-informed story like the Duke case rears its head. Mary Tillotson Tuscaloosa, Alabama Overall, your piece on the Duke case was good, and I think that you really did well on keeping the story straight, which is difficult to do with a piece that is as complicated as this one. There is one thing you did leave out, and I think it was important: That was the role of the Internet, and especially the blogs. For example, KC Johnson was able to pursue this one via his own blog which you acknowledged. There were others of us blogging as well, and we reached a number of people. I think that the rise of the blogs here was significant and provides an interesting challenge to the mainstream media. William L. Anderson Associate professor of economics Frostburg State University Frostburg, Maryland I was surprised your article didn\\'t make anything of what now seems to have been the rush to judgment by the Duke administration, including its respected president, Richard Brodhead. The vigor with which Brodhead suspended the team and dismissed the coach certainly reinforced the perception among the media that the case had merit. And while I agree entirely with your critique of the media, I think Duke and Brodhead have gotten off very lightly in subsequent coverage.

Candidate quiz questions will be distributed in advance and will require prior preparation before the quiz date. Class attendance is important! I will try to take roll at the beginning of each class, not to police attendance per se, but to help me to learn your names. Although class attendance does not formally enter into the grade calculation, an excess of absences (more than two), or excess tardiness, will indirectly affect my judgment of your scholastic commitment. Further, it can affect your grade if you are borderline between any two grade categories. Withdrawing 'W' grade will be assigned to a student if he withdraws before the middle of the quarter while doing pass work. 'WF' will be assigned to the student who withdraws before the middle of the quarter while doing failing work or withdraws after the middle of the quarter. Class participation Your class participation grade will be based on the quantity and quality of verbal contributions that you make to the class as well as your class attendance. Your project presentation will also figure into your class participation grade. Class attendance is important! If you miss more than one class your class participation grade will be jeopardized. Grades will be assigned at the conclusion of the course based on your numeric average as follows: 90 percent or higher is assigned an A 89.99 to 80 percent is assigned a B 79.99 to 70 percent is assigned a C 69.99 to 60 percent is assigned a D Less than 60 percent is assigned an F Individual Assignments: Note: all assignments are due on the date indicated. Any late assignment will be reduced in grade. Assignments that are submitted more than one week late will not be accepted (and will consequently be assigned a grade of 0). Also, all assignments are to be completed individually, not in teams of students.\\n(1) Web Site Pairs Critical Analyses of Usability (20 % of final class grade); (2) Usable Web Site Design/Implementation (25 % of final class grade); (3) Presentation 15 Minutes of Fame (5 % of final class grade) (1) Web Site Pairs Critical Analyses of Usability: Each student will write two critical essays that compare and contrast pairs of like-minded public sites (i.e. MSNBC versus CNN; Circuit City versus Best Buy), critiquing them in terms of their respective usability and suitability for purpose. Each (pair of) critical analysis will count 10 % towards your final class grade (20 % total), and each will focus on one particular topic of overall web site usability, as assigned by the instructor (for example, (i) home page design, or (ii) overall site design including primary and secondary navigation, or (iii) overall presentation and organization of content). The critical analyses are individual assignments. Electronic submissions are required as a cumulative library of all critical analyses submitted from previous CIS 8120 classes is maintained. More details about conducting each assignment will be provided later, but in general, experience has demonstrated that each of the (pairs of) critical analyses that are assigned grades in the high A range generally have the following characteristics: ? Focus on pairs of sites that have notable and explicable contrasts, i.e. one of them is generally good in terms of the focused usability topic while the second is not so good. ? Focus on pairs of sites that are like minded, that is, that target the same purpose, user population, etc. (note that this is a requirement). ? Are well organized, and written, in coherent essays exceeding 2,000 words (excluding images and screen shots). ? Contain embedded annotated screen shots that illustrate the arguments in the analysis. (2) Usable Web Site Design/Implementation: Students will develop a working web site that incorporates the principles of usability as taught in the course (using i.e. Macromedia products Dreamweaver MX, Flash MX). Students will develop a written report on their site that substantiates that the site meets acceptable standards of usability. Two distinct grades for this assignment will be assigned based on: (1) the merits of the site itself (12.5 % of your class grade); and on (2) the quality of the accompanying report substantiating why the site meets high standards of usability (12.5 % of your class grade). For their 15 minutes of fame, students may choose to demo their site to the class and explain how it meets usability objectives. More details about this assignment will be provided in class, but in general, experience has demonstrated that those projects that are assigned grades in the high A range generally have the following characteristics: ? Are substantive, well-developed sites that incorporate principles of usability as taught in the class. ? The sites contain perhaps thirty or more individual nodes. ? Are accompanied by a well-written essay of 3,500 words or more (excluding images and accompanying screen shots) that cogently and persuasively argue why the site is usable. Note that the accompanying written report is mandatory. ? Comprehensively cover the various important topics and aspects of web site usability as taught and practiced in the class. ? Contain embedded annotated screen shots (in the written report) that illustrate the arguments for usability. (3) 15 Minutes of Fame Each student will make a 15 minute presentation to the class (5 % of your total class grade). On the third week of class, each student is required to commit to a specific class date in which you will achieve your fifteen minutes of fame. More information about this assignment will be provided later. In general, you have three options for the topic of your fame legacy. You may choose to present a discussion of: (i) one of your submitted critical analyses (anytime during the semester); (ii) your developed web site and arguments for usability (late in the semester); or (iii) some other current topic pertinent to web site usability or technology (but not exclusively to web site design per se) that you find intriguing. By the third week of class, you are required to submit the date that you will present. A few more details about this assignment will be provided later, but in general, experience has demonstrated that those presentations that are assigned grades in the high A range generally have the following characteristics: ? Are substantive, enthusiastic, energetic and informative presentations that relate to topics of web site usability from the class. ? Are well received by fellow students. ? Are accompanied by visual examples and/or slides that illustrate your topical points. ? Engage the class, both in evident interest, as well as by eliciting class interaction and discussion. Course Schedule Readings\\nThe schedule on the following page outlines the required topics and readings for each weekly class. Weekly readings and slides for each scheduled class will be posted at least one week in advance. Students are responsible for all readings assigned, regardless of whether they are fully discussed in class. I reserve the right to make changes to the class schedule as the semester progresses. In addition, I will also present material for discussion in class that is not covered in the required readings. Students will be responsible for all material presented/discussed in class. Learning Objectives\\nIn the following class schedule, web usability topics will include material from the following list. There will also be in-class demos using i.e. Dreamweaver MX. Topics and readings will be posted for each class not later than one week in advance. Upon course completion, students will be able to: ? implement page and site design (including home page design and unique characteristics); ? identify examples of good/bad home page and site design; ? identify and appropriately apply site information architecture, including site topologies and approaches to navigation; ? present site features and content for any selected series of Web sites; ? develop search strategies and demonstrate search engine optimization techniques; ? properly incorporate web graphics and multimedia; ? demonstrate e-Commerce usability in a Web site of their own design. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ Weekly breakdown of classes, subject to change:\\nWeek 1: Syllabus and class introduction, HCI Principles\\nWeek 2: Overview of current Web Technologies I (X/D-HTML, XML, CSS)\\nWeek 3: Web Technologies II (Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Flash, etc.) Due: Presentation Topic & Date\\nWeek 4: Web Site Analysis and Design\\nWeek 5: Quiz 1\\nWeek 6: Principles of Page Design\\nWeek 7: Designing Content and Writing for Web\\nWeek 8: Principles of Site Design - Information Architecture 1\\nWeek 9: Information Architecture 2 Navigation\\nWeek 10: Quiz 2\\nWeek 11: Search Strategies and Search Engine Optimization / Presentations\\nWeek 12: Site Usability - Critiquing web sites / Presentations Week 13: E-Commerce usability / Presentations\\nWeek 14: Web technologies III (N-tier, web services, Java/NET)\\nWeek 15: Class Web Site Presentations\\nWeek 16: Quiz 3 (Final) Quick Links Programs BBA CIS MS CIS MBA CIS Syllabus List Schedule Apply Online Copyright 2000 Computer Information Systems Department, Georgia State University.

If you have any questions about grading, please do not hesitate to ask. Late Paper Policy:Late assignments will not be accepted, no exceptions please. Assignments must be turned in during class on the day that the assignment is due (papers will not be accepted after class). If you must miss a class it is your responsibility to make sure that assignments are turned in during or before the class you will miss. Revise and Resubmit Policy: You will be given the opportunity to revise 1 writing assignment. This assignment can be revised and resubmitted at any time throughout the semester, but must be turned by May 11. Please turn in the original paper along with the revision. The assignment will be re-graded and the new score will be substituted for the score previously earned. This offer is entirely optional; you need not revise a paper if you do not wish to do so. However, this is a great opportunity to improve a low score or to complete a paper that was not previously turned in (i.e., one you may have received 0 pts. for). Extra Credit Points Policy: If during the semester you run across current events (e.g., news clippings, articles, T.V. news stories, etc) that are applicable to course topics or information, we encourage you to bring these items or a synopsis of them to class to share. You will get 3 bonus points for each bit of information you bring. All we ask is that you indicate (specifically) where you got the information and describe how it relates to the class. Other Course Information Attendance and Punctuality Policy: Attendance is required-no differentiation is made between excused or unexcused absences; if you miss a class it counts as an absence. This class will be very interactive and will require meaningful and informed participation from everyone, therefore attendance is extremely important. If you cannot avoid missing a class it is your responsibility to get any handouts, assignment sheets or information/announcements missed. Attendance will be recorded each day; it is your responsibility to sign the attendance sheet. Finally, showing up to class late and leaving early is disruptive to the class and is, therefore, unacceptable. Do not be late and plan to stay until the end of class each day. Students showing symptoms of chronic lateness will be counseled on an individual basis. Disabilities:If you have needs addressed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, please notify us immediately and/or contact Disability Services at 882-4696 (A038 Brady Commons). Academic Honesty and Ethics: We will adhere to departmental and University policies on academic dishonesty. Please note: \"The Department of Rural Sociology hereby notifies all students that in accordance with the University regulations, ALL acts of academic dishonesty (including plagiarism) will result in the assignment of a zero or failing grade for that test/assignment and the matter will be referred to the office of the Provost for disciplinary action.\" Rural Sociology\\nAbout Us | Academics | Research/Extension | People\\nSSU | CAFNR | MU | UM System\\nCopyright 1999 Curators of the University of Missouri URL: http://www.ssu.missouri.edu/ruralsoc/academic/courses/rs120.html ']\n",

      "[' Physics 3444: Digital Electronics Spring 2013 TR 12:30-1:45, Lab T 2:00-4:50, VIN 147 PROFESSOR: Dr. David Bixler OFFICE: VIN 115 PHONE: 942-2242 EMAIL: David.Bixler@angelo.edu WEBPAGE: http://tesla.angelo.edu/~dbixler/ OFFICE HOURS: MWF 10:00-12:00am; TR 9:00-10:00am DESCRIPTION: A study of the behavior of digital logic circuit elements, with an emphasis on applications in research instrumentation, industrial controls, and computer design. Students must also be enrolled in the Physics 3444 Laboratory. STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES: Upon completion of Physics 3444, the student will demonstrate factual knowledge concerning the basic digital devices and digital circuits which comprise a simple computer system. The student will also apply logical thinking and scientific reasoning to solve quantitative problems and evaluate quantitative information in the study of basic digital devices and digital circuits. Furthermore, every student will demonstrate the technical and analytical skills for this field of study. These learning outcomes will be assessed through homework assignments, in-class exams and laboratory reports. MATERIALS: Textbook: Digital Design by Mano/Ciletti, 5th ed. COMMENTS: Angelo State University expects its students to maintain complete honesty and integrity in their academic pursuits. Students are responsible for understanding the Academic Honor Code, which is contained in both print and web versions of the Student Handbook. Persons with disabilities which may warrant academic accommodations must contact the Student Life Office, Room 112 University Center, in order to request such accommodations prior to any accommodations being implemented. A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. Attendance is required and will be taken at all class meetings. Each day you will complete a worksheet with problems covering the material discussed that day in class. There are no make-ups for these worksheets. Homework will be assigned regularly and will be due at the beginning of class on the due date specified. Homework will not be accepted once it is graded and returned to the class. Since the answers to many problems can be found in the text or on the web, some explanation or mathematics should be shown with each problem to receive full credit. Mobile phones and music players must be turned off at all times. Note that this means that you cannot use a mobile phone as your calculator. Use of any electronic device other than your calculator during an exam is not allowed. Two exams will be given during the lab period to allow for ample time to complete all problems. A comprehensive final exam will be given during the normal final exam time for this lecture period. There are no make-ups for exams, but for very special and unavoidable circumstances, a student may request special arrangements to take an exam early.

Syllabus The syllabus, including the lecture topics and readings, is in the table below. I will make every effort to stick to this time-table, but it may slip if some topics appear to require more time to discuss. You should read the assigned chapters BEFORE class. Please bring any questions about the reading to class; if I dont answer your question in the course of the lecture, please ask it. If a question comes to mind during the lecture, please ask it also. Chances are that others will have the same or a similar question, so you help everyone by asking it. Study Questions After each short series of lectures I will pass out a series of study questions. These are for you to address they should guide your review of the material. They will be discussed during the pre-exam review. Exams and Grading There will be 4 one hour exams, spaced at roughly equal intervals. The exams will consist of a set of questions that will require ~1 page answer for each. Each exam accounts for 25% of your final grade. Your final grade will be determined by the University Grading scale according to your percentage total: 90% and higher: A; 80% - 90%: B; 70% - 80%: C; 60% - 70%: D; ? 60%: F.

These mentors competed a series of six courses and nine credits geared at helping them develop coaching skills to use with beginning teachers.The commitment to impacting the practice of new teachers and subsequent student learning will enrich these mentor's classrooms and the classrooms of others. The leadership skills they bring to their districts is a cause for recognition and celebration for the following: Lisa Albers - Brown Deer\\nErin Best - Whitefish Bay\\nMary Cieslewski - Whitefish Bay\\nSusan Jones - Whitefish Bay\\nKeri Kotlewski - Whitefish Bay\\nFeliecia Mayfield - Brown Deer\\nBev Meyerhoff - Germantown\\nGail Pollock - Whitefish Bay\\nEunice Puetzer - Brown Deer\\nMarguerite Roberts - Brown Deer\\nCarol Rudebeck - Germantown\\nAliisa Sampe - Whitefish Bay\\nLisa (Leely) Sattell\\nRachell Skell - Erin\\nMichelle Trepte - Nicolet\\nMichelle Walny - Nicolet\\nHolly Warren-Ryno - Brown Deer\\nHeidi Williams - Germantown\\nKimberly Wright - Brown Deer Cardinal Stritch University Mentoring CertificateEarn nine post-baccalaureate credits taking coursework and workshops that result in a Mentoring Certificate. The program is designed for teachers and administrators interested in supporting beginning teachers through mentoring. The College of Education and Leadership of Cardinal Stritch University will award this certificate. Why should I participate? Statistics show that approximately one half of beginning teachers nationwide leave the profession within the first five years as many new teachers feel increasingly overwhelmed and underprepared. The classroom teacher is widely considered the most important factor in student achievement. So, too, the mentor teacher is the most essential feature of any high quality induction program. A mentor's knowledge and skill are especially critical in programs that seek to accelerate the development of a novice teacher's classroom practice and to create a teaching force with the capacity to meet the needs of all students in an increasingly diverse society. Therefore, according to Wisconsin's PI 34, school districts must train mentors to provide support and assistance to initial educators. To meet the demands of the spirit of the law, a mentoring certificate will ensure that mentors will gain a comprehensive and deep understanding of the knowledge and skills necessary to best serve beginning teachers. Moreover, earning a mentoring certificate will prepare those educators to become teacher leaders, thus strengthening the overall quality of education for all students in their districts.\\nWho Should Participate? You are eligible to participate in the Mentoring Certificate Program if you are a pre-K-12 educator with at least three years of teaching experience and want to mentor new teachers.

The result is formal academic study and workshop training that provides a research, theoretical and practical base for mentoring. Completing the certificate means that the workshops and courses have been attended and completed. Each person will receive a paper certificate of completion from Cardinal Stritch University's College of Education and Leadership. Credits can count toward electives in the Master of Education. Credits may also be used for salary advancement, mentorship qualifications and for professional development portfolios.

We will also examine international problems, controversies, and conflicts, while exploring United States involvement in these issues. The course will consist of case studies that will entail extensive discussion, debate, and research. Participation in oral discussions will be pertinent to the success of this class and therefore required in daily open forums. Maintaining updated knowledge of current events will help contribute to these discussions. This class is to be treated as a current events class as well as an international relations course. In order for you to keep up with the ever changing world, it will be imperative for you to watch world news, read newspapers or news magazines, or stay up to date through use of the internet!\\nGrading Policy: All assignments for this course will be allotted a point value. At the end of the marking period the total number of points the student has earned will be divided by the total number of possible earned points. This value is then turned into a percentage. Any assignment not turned in on the day it is due will only be accepted one day late and for half credit. It is your responsibility to contact the teacher for any work missed due to an excused absence. You will have as many days as you were absent to turn in any work that you missed due to that absence. Failure to turn in missed work on time will result in a 0.

Courses in the history of Russia and\\nRussian culture taught by Julie Hessler, Alan Kimball, Oleg Kripkov, and Yelaina\\nKripkov have been a part this program. Winter term, 1998, Oleg Kripkov taught a\\nREESC course, \"National Identity and Social\\nCrisis Through Contemporary Russian Texts\", under the Ford grant. At the heart\\nof the pedagogical experiment was the thought that we need to expand the foreign-language\\nexperience beyond the traditional language/literature curriculum.\\nThe program is administered out of the UO International Studies Department, and\\na full report will\\nfollow the completion of the grant period.\\nAlan Kimball, REESC Director, composed the following summary report: My objective has been to teach history with foreign-language (Russian) primary and secondary sources. This is not the same as use of historical sources to teach Russian. Language instruction is done very well in language departments. Main accent here is on reading and understanding texts in the foreign language. Some amount of exposure to the spoken language is also desirable, but I do not think it wise to make student discussion in the foreign language a significant part of the course experience. I have found it best to concentrate FLAC instruction in a special section, associated with but not bound to an existing course. In other words, recruit students into a satellite course from an existing course, preferably of broad subject matter, as in this case Russian History, a full-year course, but compose the syllabus of the satellite course in such a way that it can also \"stand alone\" as a course for students recruited from a broader population of students who have the requisite language ability and interest. The section should therefore be organized around its own particular theme, of interest to a broad range of students but sufficiently focused to present a coherent and repeated core vocabulary. In this connection, I have make every effort to attract and keep students whose foreign-language levels cover a broad spectrum. In Russian, I feel some effort has to be made to attract students in their second year of instruction, certainly in the third. The challenge is two-fold: how to satisfy the pedagogical needs of students at both intermediate and advanced levels of facility in the foreign language. The challenge is to identify appropriate texts and incorporate them in a single syllabus in such a way that students can work together in one course without some being overwhelmed and others held back. Work closely with a professional foreign-language pedagogue in all these matters. [REESC HOME] [Instruction] [\\nStudents ] [More REESC Courses ] ']\n",

      "[' Latin 226 @ Wheaton College Jan FEB APR 1 2004 2005 2007 5 captures\\n1 Feb 05 - 23 Feb 09 Close\\nHelp Instructor: Bret Mulligan Syllabus Course Description Web Resources Handouts Home Click here for a PDF of Course Description LATIN 226: Roman Lyric Spring 2003 Wheaton College 11:30 12:20 MWF Meneely Hall 303 Professor Mulligan Knapton Hall 119 E-Mail: bmulliga@wheatonma.edu Tel: x3661 Office Hours: M W F 9.30-10.20; M W 2-3 Course Description and Objectives: Latin 226 is an intermediate-level Latin literature course that will introduce you to selections of Latin lyric poetry from the 2nd century BCE to the 20th century CE. The focus of the class will be on developing your ability to read and appreciate Latin lyric poetry. Special attention will be paid to the formal analysis of poetry and in gaining a familiarity with lyric meters. What is Lyric poetry? Originally a term used to describe songs sung to the accompaniment of a lyre, lyric poetry has come to designate all non-dramatic poetry not composed in dactylic hexameter (e.g. epic, satire) or elegaic couplets (e.g elegy, epigrams). Lyric\" therefore encompasses a vast range of poetry, including hymns to gods, erotic poetry, brutal ad hominem attacks, and philosophical meditations. Weeks 1-10: We will begin by reading selections from the two major surviving lyric poets of Roman antiquity: Catullus (c. 84-54 BCE) and Horace (December 8th, 65 November 27th, 8 BCE). Catullus, a provincial aristocrat from northern Italy, was a leading member of an avant-garde group of writers called the \"Poetae Novi\", poets who openly rejected traditional Italian poetic forms and themes in favor of Greek lyric conventions and meters. Horace, the son of a freedman from a region to the southeast of Rome, was less of an overt radical than Catullus but nevertheless pushed the poetic potential of the Latin language to new heights. In the pages of his Odes can be found some of the most beautiful and well-wrought poems ever written. Because both Catullus and Horace often consciously imitating and adapting Greek poetry, whenever possible we will read samples of Greek lyric (in translation) that influenced the Roman lyric poets. Weeks 11-13: After gaining an appreciation for the canonical works on Roman lyric, we will survey examples of lyrics from the 1st and 2nd centuries CE (Petronius, Marcus Aurelius), Late Antiquity (Ausonius, Boethius, Ambrose, Fortunatus), the Middle Ages (Carmina Burana, Ecclesiastical Hymns and Songs), and contemporary Neo-Latin. Course Format, Requirements, Grading: Much of our class time will be devoted to reading and examining prepared texts and in developing skills and strategies for accurately reading Latin. This requires consistent, diligent preparation of the assigned material. While I encourage you to make use of multiple translations in preparing assignments, it is essential that you incorporate the interpretations therein in your own interpretation of the poem. You will be expected to have read and re-read Latin assignments until you can explain preferably from an unmarked text - both what is being said and how the language of the passage creates that meaning. In order to target the pace of the class as accurately as possible, a syllabus for the following week will be provided every Friday. Assignments are due on the day listed in the syllabus. Adequate advanced notice of exams and papers will be provided. As you well know, language acquisition and cultivation requires daily preparation, attendance, and participation. Because of the unavoidable vicissitudes of fate and health, I will excuse up to 2 absences in the course of the semester. Additional absences without my prior approval will result in a reduction of your course grade by 3 points. I will evaluate you based on your performance in class, on written homework assignments (also known as parsing assignments), and on frequent announced and unannounced quizzes. Throughout the semester, various topics will be assigned for brief in-class presentations. Also, there will be short projects and presentations spread throughout the semester culminating in an 8-10 page final project. These will allow the class to gain a broader understanding of the historical epochs under consideration and of the production and interpretation of poetic texts. Your final grade will be calculated based on the following formula: Class preparation & Assignments40% In-semester exams & Quizzes 20% Final Project: 20% Short papers and presentations: 20% Attendance +/- Required Texts (226) Catullus = The Student\\'s Catullus, 2nd edition, ed.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS Instructional / Methods / Tasks / Projects / Assessments This course occurs in a digital learning environment designed with a module format. All discussion, quiz and performance task. You will be expected to read assigned material, participate in discussions and group tasks, reflect on your knowledge growth and complete all assigned tasks/projects by the due date. Late work will not be accepted. Therefore you need to demonstrate a level of time management that allows you to meet due dates as posted. Participate in all online group/class discussions. There will be an opportunity to work as an individual, with a partner or in a group of 3-4 students. Working with a partner or in a group requires you to follow my CCC: collaboration, cooperation, and completion. This means, as an adult learner, you will collaborate with another student or students in a cooperative manner to complete a quality product. I truly believe two minds are better than one so I encourage partnerships or groups. However, I WILL NOT mediate should an issue arise pertaining to CCC; you are expected to find a resolution. You will always have the choice to opt out of the partnership or group and work as an individual. Therefore, you are expected to show a level of professionalism and stay actively engaged with your partner or the group through communication and contributions to complete the project. Read required textbook. The student will be expected to read the required text and any supplemental materials. This is an online course that presents written information as an alternate mode of lecture. Do not take this lightly; as an online course you are expected to read/reflect for meaning. Reflections: throughout the course, the student may be asked to consider ideas presented in articles and threaded discussions. Some of the reflections will be assigned and submitted to the instructor, others will be for personal reflection and kept by the student. Written tasks: Completion of all discussions/reflections and projects should exhibit professionalism in appearance and content at an acceptable level of scholarship. Projects are to be completed and turned in according to the due date posted in eCollege. Late work will not be accepted without an excused absence and/or extenuating circumstances as determined by the instructor with a late due date determined by the instructor. The campus library and/or computer labs are available for use in the event personal technology fails or supplies or assistance is needed. Grading I make it a personal goal to grade module assignments within one week after due dates. eCollege provides you with a current grade average so you can monitor your course grade at any time during the semester.

To me, this implies that while many documents are obviously syllabi or not, at a certain point, there is a sharp increase in ambiguity. This mirrors my experience with labeling the syllabi, where sometimes it was close enough that I gave ambiguous responses across trials. For example, I didn't have a rigorous take toward how to classify course teasers in catalogs."
